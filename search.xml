<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>The rapid advancement of neural networks has led to breakthroughs in various domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, the deployment of these powerful models is often hindered by the computational intensity and resource demands they impose, making them incompatible with resource-constrained platforms like mobile devices and IoT edge devices.</p>
<p>The key challenge lies in the significant variance in hardware characteristics across different platforms, which necessitates neural network architectures that can be efficiently adapted to leverage these traits. Furthermore, real-world applications often impose diverse constraints, such as strict latency requirements for real-time processing or energy efficiency for extended battery life, further complicating the design and deployment of neural networks.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, the paper introduces Chameleon, a novel framework for efficient neural network architecture design that prioritizes given resource constraints. Chameleon eschews the traditional approaches of developing new building blocks or employing computationally expensive reinforcement learning algorithms. Instead, it focuses on the strategic allocation of computation resources, adapting to the hardware traits of the target platform, and aligning with specific latency and energy constraints.</p>
<p>The framework operates within an optimization framework, utilizing predictive models for accuracy, latency, and energy to expedite the search for optimal architectures. By harnessing Gaussian Process with Bayesian optimization, Chameleon significantly reduces the time required to produce state-of-the-art models that excel in various platforms and scenarios, without the need for special features or extensive computational resources. This innovative methodology promises a new era of efficient neural network design, offering improved performance while respecting the limitations of real-world deployment environments.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>Firstly, it introduces a novel concept of computation distribution, demonstrating that adapting computation resources to building blocks is crucial for model performance. This insight allows the Chameleon framework to achieve substantial accuracy improvements over existing handcrafted and automatically designed architectures, without incorporating any special features.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330164901236.png" alt="image-20240330164901236"></p>
<p>Secondly, the paper proposes an efficient algorithm for searching optimal architectures through accurate and resource predictors. This algorithm leverages Gaussian Process with Bayesian optimization to enable a more effective search, outperforming reinforcement learning-based approaches in terms of search efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors present a scalable and automated methodology for neural network architecture adaptation. The Chameleon framework, with its predictive models for accuracy, latency, and energy consumption, significantly reduces the search time and computational overhead. It achieves this by bypassing the need for extensive network training and direct performance metric measurements, which are typically required in traditional NAS and SMBO methods.</p>
<p>Lastly, the paper showcases the adaptability and generality of the Chameleon framework through extensive experiments on various hardware platforms, including mobile CPUs, DSPs, and GPUs. The results consistently show higher accuracy and reduced runtime latency compared to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the framework’s potential for large-scale heterogeneous deployment in real-world applications.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330164914312.png" alt="image-20240330164914312"></p>
<p>The methodology use a comprehensive framework designed to efficiently adapt neural network architectures to specific platforms and constraints. This approach, known as Chameleon, is centered around the concept of platform-aware model adaptation, which involves several key components and steps.</p>
<p><strong>Platform-aware Model Adaptation:</strong><br>The Chameleon framework begins by taking a default neural network architecture and a specific use scenario, which includes the target platform and resource budget. It then generates an adapted architecture that fits the scenario through an efficient evolutionary search (EES). This search is based on an adaptive genetic algorithm, where each architecture is represented by a vector of hyperparameters. The fitness of each candidate architecture is evaluated based on predictive models, and the best-performing ones are selected for the next generation through mutation and crossover operators.</p>

<p><strong>Predictive Models:</strong><br>To expedite the search process, Chameleon employs predictive models for accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. These models bypass the time-consuming training and measurement process, allowing for immediate performance metric estimation. The accuracy predictor is built on a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor with Bayesian optimization, which provides reliable predictions and uncertainty estimations, guiding the sample architecture selection for training.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Accuracy Predictor:</strong><br>The accuracy predictor is designed to estimate the final accuracy of a model without actual training. It uses a GP regressor, chosen for its reliability with scarce training data and its ability to produce predictions with uncertainty estimations. The sample architecture selection process is enhanced with Bayesian optimization, focusing on exploitation and exploration samples to improve convergence speed and sample efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Latency Predictor:</strong><br>Latency is a critical performance metric, and Chameleon constructs an operator latency look-up table (LUT) for fast and accurate latency estimation. This LUT, supported by a latency database from real-device benchmarks, allows for the summation of operator-level latencies to estimate the network-level latency. This method significantly reduces the time required for latency estimation compared to direct hardware measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Energy Predictor:</strong><br>For devices with limited energy budgets, Chameleon includes an energy predictor. Similar to the accuracy predictor, it uses a GP model and Bayesian optimization but focuses solely on exploration samples to increase prediction confidence across the search space.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong> The authors employ a range of neural network architectures, including MobileNetV2 and ResNet, as the base models for adaptation. These models are chosen for their widespread use and proven performance in computer vision tasks. The experimental platforms include the Snapdragon 835 mobile CPU, Hexagon v62 DSP, Intel Xeon Broadwell CPU, and Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU. These diverse platforms allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the Chameleon framework’s ability to adapt to different hardware characteristics.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330165156604.png" alt="image-20240330165156604"></p>
<p>The framework is tested under various latency and energy constraints to mimic real-world deployment scenarios. For mobile platforms, the constraints range from 4ms to 30ms, while for server models, they vary from 50ms to 400ms. Energy constraints are also set for mobile models, ranging from 15mJ to 150mJ, to reflect the energy limitations of battery-powered devices.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330165206854.png" alt="image-20240330165206854"></p>
<p>The experiments utilize the ImageNet dataset, a standard benchmark for image classification, consisting of 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images. The dataset’s complexity and diversity provide a robust testbed for evaluating the adapted models’ accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Results:</strong> The results of the experiments demonstrate that the Chameleon framework consistently outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy under the given constraints. For mobile platforms, the adapted ChamNet-Mobile models achieve top-1 accuracy rates of 73.8% and 75.3% on the Snapdragon 835 CPU and Hexagon v62 DSP, respectively, at 20ms latency. These rates represent significant improvements over baseline models like MobileNetV2 and MnasNet.</p>
<p>On server platforms, the ChamNet-Res models also show superior performance, with top-1 accuracy rates improving from 72.7% to 78.5% on an Intel CPU under 400ms latency constraint, and from 70.8% to 78.6% on an Nvidia GPU under 15ms latency constraint.</p>
<p>In the energy-driven adaptation experiments, ChamNet-Mobile demonstrates a notable improvement in the accuracy-energy trade-off. For instance, the model achieves 60.0% accuracy at only 14mJ per run, a 26% reduction in energy consumption compared to the MobileNetV2 0.75x baseline.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330165220972.png" alt="image-20240330165220972"></p>
<p>The paper also compares Chameleon with alternative adaptation and compression approaches, such as MNAS, AMC, NetAdapt, and MorphNet. The comparisons show that Chameleon offers the most favorable accuracy-latency trade-offs and reduces the computational cost from O(m · n · k) to O(m + n), where m, n, and k represent the number of network models, distinct platforms, and use scenarios, respectively.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the experimental results validate the Chameleon framework’s capability to efficiently adapt neural network architectures to meet specific performance and resource constraints. The consistent improvements in accuracy and efficiency across various platforms and scenarios highlight the practicality and potential of the Chameleon approach for real-world applications.</p>

    <title>Analyzing Transformer Models: Parameters</title>
    <url>/2022/09/28/ATM_parameter/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT has demonstrated outstanding performance, sparking a research frenzy in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). The “large” in Large Language Models is reflected in two aspects: the scale of model parameters and the scale of training data. Taking GPT-3 as an example, it boasts a staggering 175 billion parameters and was trained on a colossal dataset of 570 GB. Consequently, training Large Language Models faces two primary challenges: GPU memory efficiency and computational efficiency.</p>
<p>In the current landscape of the industry, large language models are predominantly built upon the Transformer architecture. These models can be broadly categorized into two main types: encoder-decoder models (with T5 as a representative) and decoder-only models. Specifically, decoder-only structures can be further divided into Causal LM (exemplified by the GPT series) and Prefix LM (represented by models like GLM). Due to the tremendous success achieved by the GPT series, the majority of mainstream large language models opt for the Causal LM structure. As a result, this series of articles delve into an analysis of model parameters, computational complexity, intermediate activation values, and KV cache to gain a deeper understanding of the GPU memory efficiency and computational efficiency involved in training large language models.</p>

This discussion specifically analyzes the GPU memory occupation of parameters, gradients, and optimizer state, with a detailed introduction to the memory occupation of intermediate activations to follow later. When training large models, the AdamW optimizer is commonly used, and mixed-precision training is employed to accelerate the training. The analysis of GPU memory usage is based on this premise.</p>
<p>In a single training iteration, each trainable model parameter corresponds to one gradient and two optimizer states (first and second momentum of the gradient in the Adam optimizer).

    <title>Edd: Efficient differentiable dnn architecture and implementation co-search for embedded ai solutions</title>
    <url>/2021/08/28/Edd/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02563.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the quest for high-quality AI solutions has led to a growing interest in the joint optimization of AI algorithms and their hardware implementations. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the workhorse of modern AI, have demonstrated remarkable achievements but are often limited by the efficiency of their hardware deployment. Traditional approaches to enhance algorithm quality, such as neural architecture search (NAS), have focused on developing DNNs that surpass human-designed architectures. However, these methods often overlook the simultaneous optimization of hardware implementations, which is crucial for improving performance metrics like latency, throughput, and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Recent advancements in hardware-aware NAS and hardware/software co-design have begun to address this gap by considering hardware features in DNN design. Yet, there remains a significant opportunity to further optimize by integrating the hardware implementation search within the NAS process. This integration can provide more accurate performance evaluations and instant guidance for hardware-aware DNN design.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>These contributions collectively push the boundaries of AI research by providing a comprehensive framework that enhances the quality and efficiency of AI solutions, particularly for embedded systems where performance and resource constraints are paramount.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The methodology at the core of this research is an innovative approach to the co-search problem, which integrates the search for optimal DNN architectures with the search for efficient hardware implementations. This is achieved through a differentiable framework that allows for a unified optimization process.</p>
<p>At the outset, the research introduces a mathematical formulation that combines DNN search variables, which define the structure and parameters of the network, with hardware implementation variables, which pertain to the physical realization of the DNN on various devices. This fusion creates a unified solution space where both algorithm accuracy and hardware performance are optimized simultaneously.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181352045.png" alt="image-20240330181352045"></p>
<p>The key innovation lies in the differentiability of the formulation. By ensuring that the objective function, which includes both accuracy loss and performance loss, is differentiable with respect to the fused variables, gradient descent algorithms can be applied. This enables efficient optimization, significantly reducing the search time compared to traditional exhaustive search methods.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181403203.png" alt="image-20240330181403203"></p>
<p>The methodology also introduces a unique approach to differentiable quantization, a critical aspect of hardware implementation. Quantization involves reducing the precision of data to increase computational efficiency, but it must be carefully balanced with the impact on DNN accuracy. The proposed method uses a Gumbel-Softmax function to convert the discrete, non-differentiable sampling of quantization into a continuous, differentiable process. This allows for the optimization of quantization levels in tandem with the DNN architecture.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the methodology provides a comprehensive performance and resource formulation that captures the intermediate performance and resource usage of each DNN operation and block. This includes the latency of operations under different quantization schemes and the resource requirements in terms of hardware-specific parameters, such as the number of DSPs on an FPGA.</p>
<p>The co-search process is carried out in a bilevel fashion. In the first level, the DNN weights are optimized on the training dataset to minimize the training loss. In the second level, the DNN architecture and implementation variables are updated by minimizing the objective function on the validation set. This iterative process continues until convergence or a fixed number of epochs is reached.</p>
<p>The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology through extensive experiments on three different hardware platforms: GPUs, recursive FPGA accelerators, and pipelined FPGA accelerators. For each platform, a representative DNN model is searched and optimized, achieving competitive accuracy while significantly improving performance metrics such as latency and throughput.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p>The experimental setup of this research is meticulously designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed co-search methodology. The experiments are conducted on a subset of the ImageNet dataset, which is a standard benchmark for evaluating DNN models. The models searched by the methodology are trained from scratch on the entire ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1000 classes, to ensure a comprehensive assessment of their performance.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181427801.png" alt="image-20240330181427801"></p>
<p>Three distinct DNN models, referred to as EDD-Nets, are targeted in the experiments: EDD-Net-1 for low-latency GPU implementation, EDD-Net-2 for recursive FPGA architecture, and EDD-Net-3 for pipelined FPGA architecture. The initial DNN for the search consists of 20 MBConv blocks, with each block offering a variety of operation candidates defined by different filter sizes and channel expansion ratios. The DNN weights and activations are optimized for each hardware platform, considering the specific constraints and capabilities of GPUs and FPGAs.</p>
<p>The experiments utilize a fixed number of epochs for the EDD search process, with the DNN weights updated through stochastic gradient descent. The architecture and implementation variables are optimized using a bilevel approach, where the DNN weights are first fixed and the objective function is minimized over the validation set. This process is repeated until the training converges or the predefined number of epochs is completed.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181441030.png" alt="image-20240330181441030"></p>
<p>The results of the experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the co-search methodology. EDD-Net-1 achieves a top-1 test error of 25.3% and a latency of 11.17 ms on the Titan RTX GPU, outperforming existing hardware-aware NAS approaches in terms of inference speed. When re-trained and fine-tuned on an Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU, EDD-Net-1 shows a latency reduction across different data precisions, with the shortest latency of 1.74 ms achieved using 8-bit integer precision.</p>
<p>For FPGA implementations, EDD-Net-2 and EDD-Net-3 are compared with state-of-the-art solutions. EDD-Net-2, optimized for a recursive FPGA accelerator, delivers a latency of 7.96 ms on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA, outperforming other models by a significant margin. EDD-Net-3, designed for a pipelined FPGA architecture, achieves a throughput of 40.2 frames per second on the ZC706 FPGA, indicating a 1.45倍 increase in performance over the previous best solution.</p>

    <title>Direct federated neural architecture search</title>
    <url>/2022/01/01/DFNAs/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://dp-ml.github.io/2021-workshop-ICLR/files/32.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading approach for training machine learning models in a privacy-preserving manner, by allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without directly sharing their data. However, the effectiveness of FL is often limited by the use of static, predefined neural network architectures that do not account for the diverse and heterogeneous nature of client-held data.</p>
<p>In the realm of neural network design, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has demonstrated significant potential in automating the discovery of high-performing architectures tailored to specific tasks and datasets. Yet, the integration of NAS with FL has been hindered by the computational demands of existing methods and their inability to adapt to the non-IID data distribution common in FL scenarios.</p>
<p>This discrepancy between the potential benefits of NAS and the practical challenges of its application in FL environments underscores the need for a more efficient and adaptable approach. The goal is to develop an end-to-end NAS technique that can seamlessly operate within the constraints of FL, dynamically searching for and optimizing neural network architectures that not only enhance model accuracy but also minimize resource usage.</p>
<p>Such an approach would be pivotal in unlocking the full potential of FL, enabling it to deliver more accurate and personalized models at scale, while upholding the privacy and regulatory requirements of various domains. By overcoming the computational and data distribution barriers, this research aims to propel FL towards broader adoption and more impactful applications.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>This research introduces a groundbreaking method that significantly advances the field of Federated Learning (FL) by seamlessly integrating Neural Architecture Search (NAS) into the FL framework. The primary contributions of this work are threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It pioneers the concept of FedNAS for both cross-silo and cross-device environments, where data is partitioned by examples, and the architecture is learned in tandem with model parameters. This innovative approach allows for the discovery of optimal neural network architectures that are tailored to the specific characteristics of each client’s data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The proposed method offers an efficient, plug-and-play solution for searching and deploying neural network architectures within the federated setting. By eliminating the need for retraining the derived network on the clients, it simplifies the process and reduces the computational overhead, making it suitable for low-resource devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Through extensive experiments, the research demonstrates a substantial reduction in communication rounds and computational resources compared to existing methods. For the same number of communication rounds, the method achieves an average test accuracy improvement of up to 10% compared to predefined models with Federated Averaging (FedAvg).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These contributions collectively pave the way for more efficient, accurate, and resource-conscious FL systems, capable of handling the intricacies of real-world data distributions and computational constraints. The work sets a new standard for the application of NAS in FL, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the pursuit of optimized and privacy-preserving machine learning models.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330173119893.png" alt="image-20240330173119893"></p>
<p>The methodology presented in this research is a novel approach to addressing the challenges of applying Neural Architecture Search (NAS) within the context of Federated Learning (FL). The core of this approach is a direct federated NAS technique that is designed to identify and optimize neural network architectures in a one-stage process, specifically tailored for the heterogeneous and distributed nature of FL environments.</p>
<p>The method begins by defining the problem within the federated learning paradigm, where multiple clients, each with their own local data, collaborate to train a shared model without exchanging data. The key innovation is the inclusion of the network architecture as a variable parameter, alongside the traditional model weights. This allows for the simultaneous optimization of both the architecture and the model parameters, aiming to maximize the predictive performance on the given task.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the method employs a parent network, which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the search space of possible neural network architectures. Each node in the DAG corresponds to an intermediate representation of the data, and the edges represent transformations such as pooling or convolution. Multiple edges between nodes represent the different architectural choices available.</p>
<p>The algorithm then samples a set of architecture parameters, which are used to construct a child network from the parent network. This child network is trained on the local data of each client using a standard optimization process, with gradients being backpropagated not only through the weights but also through the architecture parameters. This allows the algorithm to learn which architectural choices are most beneficial for the given data.</p>
<p>A key aspect of this method is its hardware-agnostic nature, meaning it can be applied to any type of client hardware, from multi-GPU clusters in data centers to edge devices like smartphones. The parent network is constructed based on the hardware configuration, ensuring that the search process is tailored to the specific computational capabilities of the target devices.</p>
<p>The federated aspect of the method is orchestrated by a central server, which selects a subset of clients to participate in each training round. The server aggregates the updates from the clients, updating the global architecture and weight parameters accordingly. This process is repeated over multiple rounds until convergence or a predetermined stopping criterion is met.</p>
<p>The method’s one-stage nature is a significant departure from traditional two-stage NAS methods, which often require a separate retraining phase after the architecture has been discovered. By integrating the search and training processes, this approach reduces the overall computational cost and communication overhead, making it more suitable for the resource-constrained FL setting.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330173241086.png" alt="image-20240330173241086"></p>
<p>The experimental framework of this research is meticulously designed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed direct federated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method within the context of Federated Learning (FL). The experiments are structured to assess the computational efficiency, communication rounds, and test accuracy of the method in comparison to existing approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong></p>
<p>The experiments are conducted using the FedML research library, which provides a comprehensive platform for FL experimentation. The target task for evaluation is image classification, a widely recognized benchmark for assessing machine learning models. Two primary datasets are utilized: the CIFAR-10 dataset for cross-silo settings and the CINIC-10 dataset for cross-device settings. These datasets are manipulated to create both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID data distributions to simulate various real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>The search space for the parent network is constructed using shuffle blocks, with different configurations for cross-silo and cross-device experiments to accommodate the diversity of client devices. The method’s performance is compared against the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm and other federated NAS methods, such as FedNAS and MiLeNAS.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330173312878.png" alt="image-20240330173312878"></p>
<p><strong>Experimental Results:</strong></p>
<p>The results of the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in computational efficiency and test accuracy. The proposed method achieves an order of magnitude reduction in resource consumption compared to prior art, with a notable reduction in communication rounds required for training. This reduction is crucial for FL, as it minimizes the data transmitted between clients and the server, thereby preserving privacy and reducing energy consumption.</p>
<p>In terms of test accuracy, the method outperforms predefined models with FedAvg, showing an average improvement of up to 10% for the same number of communication rounds. This improvement is attributed to the method’s ability to adapt the network architecture to the specific characteristics of the non-IID data, leading to more accurate and robust models.</p>
<p>The experiments also reveal that the method is highly scalable and robust across different client configurations. The performance of the method remains consistent even as the number of clients and the distribution of data vary, showcasing its adaptability to diverse FL environments.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the memory consumption during the search process is significantly lower than other methods, making the approach viable for deployment on low-memory hardware such as smartphones and IoT devices. This is a critical aspect for real-world FL applications, where client devices can have significantly varying computational capabilities.</p>

    <url>/2020/01/12/Enas./</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a revolutionary approach to automate the design of neural network architectures, offering the potential to discover high-performing models without the need for manual trial and error. However, the computational cost and time consumption associated with NAS have been prohibitive, often requiring hundreds of GPUs and days of training to find optimal architectures.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330144354863.png" alt="image-20240330144354863"></p>
<p>The motivation behind Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) stems from the need to address these challenges and make NAS more accessible and efficient. By introducing a paradigm where a controller discovers neural network architectures within a large computational graph through parameter sharing, ENAS dramatically reduces the resources required for the search process. This innovative method not only maintains the empirical performance of traditional NAS but also achieves it with a fraction of the computational expense, using only a single GPU and a matter of hours.</p>
<p>ENAS’s ability to share parameters among child models during the search process is a key factor in its efficiency. This design choice allows for a more stable and effective learning process for the controller, which in turn can explore a vast search space of architectures more thoroughly and rapidly than its counterparts. The result is a method that not only discovers state-of-the-art architectures for tasks like image classification and language modeling but also does so in a way that is practical and scalable.</p>
<p>By democratizing access to advanced neural network design through ENAS, researchers and practitioners can now focus more on innovation and less on the resource-intensive process of architecture search. This shift has the potential to accelerate advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, unlocking new possibilities and applications that were previously out of reach due to the computational barriers of traditional NAS methods.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) makes several significant contributions to the field of automated machine learning (AutoML). Firstly, it introduces a novel approach to neural architecture search by leveraging parameter sharing among a multitude of child models. This innovative strategy allows ENAS to explore a vast design space with remarkable efficiency, using a single GPU and within a few hours, which is a stark contrast to the extensive computational resources required by traditional NAS methods.</p>
<p>Secondly, ENAS demonstrates that parameter sharing not only reduces computational costs but also leads to competitive model performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on established benchmarks such as the Penn Treebank dataset for language modeling and the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification, matching or even surpassing the performance of architectures found by more expensive NAS methods.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ENAS presents a flexible framework that can be applied to various types of neural networks, from recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image data. This versatility is a testament to the general applicability of ENAS and its potential to impact a wide range of domains within machine learning.</p>
<p>Lastly, ENAS’s contributions extend to the methodology of neural architecture search itself. By improving the efficiency of the search process, ENAS opens up new possibilities for research and experimentation. It enables more researchers to engage in neural architecture research, fostering innovation and potentially leading to the discovery of even more efficient and effective methods in the future. The impact of ENAS is thus both immediate, through its superior performance and efficiency, and long-term, as it paves the way for further advancements in the field of AutoML.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>In the pursuit of enhancing the efficiency of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), the paper introduces Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a groundbreaking method that stands out for its innovative use of parameter sharing and computational graph optimization. The specific methodologies employed in ENAS can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330144735504.png" alt="image-20240330144735504"></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Controller and Child Models</strong>: At the heart of ENAS lies a controller, typically an LSTM RNN, which is responsible for sampling decisions to construct child models. These child models are subgraphs within a larger computational graph, and they share the same set of parameters, which drastically reduces the computational resources needed to search for and train new architectures.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330144757765.png"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Parameter Sharing</strong>: A pivotal concept in ENAS is the sharing of parameters across all child models. This is achieved by defining the search space as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent local computations and edges represent the flow of information. Each node in the DAG has its own set of parameters, which are used when the node is active in a child model. By sharing parameters, ENAS minimizes redundancy and maximizes the efficiency of the search process.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Policy Gradient for Controller Training</strong>: The controller is trained using policy gradient methods, specifically the REINFORCE algorithm. It selects subgraphs (child models) that are expected to yield high rewards on a validation set. The reward function is designed to encourage the selection of models that generalize well, steering the search towards architectures that perform well on unseen data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Training Procedure</strong>: ENAS employs a two-phase training process. The first phase involves training the shared parameters (ω) of the child models on the entire training dataset. The second phase focuses on training the controller’s parameters (θ) to optimize the policy that selects child models. These phases are interleaved, with the controller learning from the performance of the child models it generates.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Designing Recurrent and Convolutional Cells</strong>: ENAS provides a flexible framework for designing both recurrent and convolutional architectures. For recurrent cells, the controller decides on the connections and operations within a DAG, allowing for the creation of complex RNN structures.

</li>
<li><p><strong>Efficient Search Space Representation</strong>: The search space in ENAS is represented as a DAG, where each possible architecture is a subgraph of this larger structure. This representation allows for an exponential number of configurations, making the search space comprehensive and diverse, yet tractable due to parameter sharing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330144921006.png" alt="image-20240330144921006"></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Deriving Final Architectures</strong>: Once the controller is trained, ENAS derives final architectures by sampling from the policy and selecting the model with the highest expected reward for further training. This process can be repeated with different samples to explore the search space more thoroughly, although the paper demonstrates that even a single sample can yield competitive results.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330145132477.png" alt="image-20240330145132477"></p>
<p>The experimental results presented in the paper on Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) are both compelling and insightful, showcasing the method’s effectiveness in discovering high-performing neural network architectures while significantly reducing computational costs.

The results consistently show that ENAS can match or exceed the performance of other methods while using a fraction of the resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Search Space Complexity</strong>: ENAS’s ability to handle complex search spaces was demonstrated by its application to both RNN cells and convolutional networks. The method’s flexibility in designing different types of neural networks highlights its potential for widespread use in various machine learning tasks.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the experiments conducted in the paper provide strong evidence of ENAS’s capabilities. They not only validate the method’s efficiency in terms of computational resource usage but also confirm its ability to discover state-of-the-art neural network architectures that are competitive with those found by more expensive search methods. These results position ENAS as a promising approach for democratizing access to advanced neural architecture search and accelerating innovation in the field of machine learning.</p>

    <url>/2021/09/03/FedMask/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3485730.3485929">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181940888.png" alt="image-20240330181940888"></p>
<p>In the realm of mobile deep learning applications, the challenge of training sophisticated models on devices with limited data and computational resources is a significant hurdle. Traditional approaches that rely on centralizing data for model training often compromise privacy and consume substantial communication bandwidth. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution, enabling decentralized training without sharing raw data, thus upholding privacy. However, non-IID data distribution across devices and limited communication bandwidth present major obstacles to practical FL deployment. Moreover, the computational efficiency of training and running Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on mobile devices is critical due to their restricted resources.

<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330181950985.png" alt="image-20240330181950985"></p>
<p>This research pioneers a new federated learning paradigm that simultaneously enhances communication and computational efficiency while preserving personalization for mobile devices. The key contribution lies in the introduction of a novel framework that employs heterogeneous binary masking. This innovative approach allows for the learning of a personalized and structured sparse Deep Neural Network (DNN) on each device, which can operate efficiently despite the limited resources typically found on mobile devices.</p>
<p>By communicating only binary masks, rather than entire model parameters, the framework drastically reduces the communication burden. The masks, once learned, are optimized through a structured sparsity regularization method, which not only maintains the personalized aspects of each device’s local data but also leads to a compact model that demands less computational power during training and inference.</p>
<p>The framework’s ability to improve inference accuracy by a significant margin, coupled with its substantial reductions in both communication and computation costs, marks a significant advancement in the field of federated learning. It provides a unified solution that addresses the critical challenges of statistical heterogeneity, communication bandwidth limitations, and computational constraints, setting a new standard for deploying on-device deep learning applications efficiently and effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330182001287.png" alt="image-20240330182001287"></p>
<p>The methodology at the core of this research revolves around a novel federated learning (FL) framework that efficiently addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity, communication bandwidth constraints, and computational limitations on mobile devices. The framework’s unique approach is to leverage heterogeneous binary masking, which allows each device to learn a personalized and structured sparse Deep Neural Network (DNN).</p>

<p>The process begins with a one-shot pruning method that initializes a heterogeneous binary mask for each device, based on its local data. This mask determines the structure of the sparse DNN that will be learned by the device. During subsequent communication rounds, instead of transmitting the entire model update, each device only communicates the optimized binary mask to the central server. This mask is applied to a fixed set of model parameters, which remain unchanged throughout the learning process.</p>

<p>The key innovation lies in the structured sparsity regularization applied to the binary mask optimization. This regularization encourages the learning of a sparse model that is not only personalized to the local data distribution but also computationally efficient. The regularization promotes channel-wise and filter-wise sparsity in convolutional layers and row-wise or column-wise sparsity in fully connected layers, resulting in a compact model that requires less computation during both training and inference.</p>

<p>The aggregation strategy on the central server is carefully designed to preserve the personalized information embedded in the heterogeneous binary masks. The server only aggregates elements that are common across the binary masks from different devices, ensuring that the unique structures learned by each device are not lost.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330182036543.png" alt="image-20240330182036543"></p>
<p>The framework’s approach to handling different types of layers, such as convolutional and fully connected layers, within the DNN is crucial for maintaining the model’s expressiveness and performance. For instance, the framework adapts the pruning method to the specific needs of layers like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which have a chain-like structure, to prevent significant performance drops.</p>

    <title>Fednas: Federated deep learning via neural architecture search</title>
    <url>/2021/09/28/FedNas/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1OHZX4YDqhT">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for decentralized machine learning, addressing privacy and communication constraints by avoiding centralized data storage. However, FL faces significant challenges due to the non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) of user data, which often leads to suboptimal performance of models trained using predefined architectures designed for centralized data. This data heterogeneity necessitates a more tailored approach to model development within the FL framework.</p>
<p>The paper introduces FedNAS, a novel approach to Federated Neural Architecture Search, aiming to automate and enhance model design for FL by collaboratively searching for optimal neural architectures among distributed workers. By personalizing not only the model weights but also the architecture itself, FedNAS seeks to overcome the limitations imposed by data heterogeneity and achieve higher accuracy than traditional methods.</p>
<p>The motivation behind FedNAS stems from the observation that existing FL algorithms, which focus on optimization strategies, often overlook the importance of model selection and design. By leveraging the power of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), FedNAS offers a complementary solution that adapts to the unique data distributions present at each FL user, leading to more efficient and effective learning models. This research explores the integration of NAS into the FL paradigm, presenting a new direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in decentralized machine learning.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>The paper presents several key contributions to the field of Federated Learning (FL) through the introduction of FedNAS, a novel framework for Federated Neural Architecture Search. The primary contributions are threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Collaborative Model Personalization</strong>: FedNAS pioneers a method for collaboratively searching for both global and personalized model architectures among edge devices in FL settings. This approach allows for the co-optimization of model weights and architecture parameters, leading to models that are better suited to the specific data distributions of individual users.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing Data Heterogeneity</strong>: Recognizing the challenge of non-IID data in FL, FedNAS employs NAS to find architectures that can adapt to users’ unique data characteristics more effectively than existing local adaptation and personalization techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that FedNAS can achieve superior performance, showcasing its ability to handle data heterogeneity and improve model accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>State-of-the-Art Performance</strong>: FedNAS is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in both cross-silo and cross-device FL settings. The architecture searched by FedNAS outperforms manually predefined architectures and existing personalized FL methods, such as Ditto and perFedAvg, in terms of validation accuracy. This highlights the potential of FedNAS as a leading approach for model development in decentralized learning environments.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330170025813.png" alt="image-20240330170025813"></p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330170035786.png" alt="image-20240330170035786"></p>
<p>The methodology of the paper revolves around the Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) framework, which is designed to automate and optimize the model design process in a federated learning (FL) environment. The core of FedNAS lies in its ability to collaboratively search for neural architectures that are better suited for the non-IID (non-identical and independently distributed) data present at FL users. Here’s an in-depth look at the key components and steps involved in the FedNAS approach:</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330170133782.png" alt="image-20240330170133782"></p>
<p><strong>1. Problem Definition and Search Space:</strong> The paper begins by defining the FL setting, where there are multiple nodes (clients), each with its own non-IID dataset. The objective is to minimize the loss function across all clients by optimizing both the network weights and the neural architecture. The search space for FedNAS is inspired by the mixed-operation search space used in prior NAS works like DARTS and MiLeNAS, which allows for the exploration of shared convolutional cells that form the basis of the eventual model architecture.</p>
<p><strong>2. Local Search with MiLeNAS:</strong> Each client performs a local search using an improved variant of the gradient-based method, MiLeNAS, which is computationally efficient and suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This local search involves optimizing the network weights and architecture parameters simultaneously using a mixed-level optimization technique, where the loss with respect to both training and validation data is considered.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330170149421.png" alt="image-20240330170149421"></p>
<p><strong>3. Federated Architecture Search (FedNAS):</strong> The FedNAS algorithm operates in a multi-step process. Initially, clients search locally for optimal architecture parameters (α) and weights (w). These are then sent to a central server, which aggregates the gradients from all clients to obtain a global set of α and w. These global parameters are subsequently synced back to the clients for further local searches. This iterative process continues until convergence, with the goal of finding a personalized architecture that fits the scattered data distributions effectively.</p>
<p><strong>4. Personalized FedNAS:</strong> In addition to global model search, FedNAS also supports personalization. After the initial search process, clients can further fine-tune the received global model locally by alternating the optimization of their local architecture and model weights. This local adaptation step enhances the model’s robustness against local data heterogeneity.</p>

<p><strong>5. System Efficiency and Experiments:</strong> The paper also addresses the efficiency of the FedNAS framework by comparing its search time and parameter size with those of FedAvg, a widely used FL algorithm. FedNAS is shown to find better architectures with fewer parameters in less time than FedAvg. Extensive experiments are conducted on non-IID datasets, including CIFAR-10 and GLD-23K, to evaluate the performance of FedNAS in both global model training and personalized model training scenarios. The results consistently demonstrate FedNAS’s superiority over other personalization methods and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong></p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330171026249.png" alt="image-20240330171026249"></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Datasets and Non-IID Data Distributions:</strong> The experiments utilize the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, and the GLD-23K dataset, which contains 23,000 images. To simulate non-IID data, the training images are split among clients in an unbalanced manner, creating label-skewed and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based distributions. This ensures that the models must learn to generalize well despite the variability in data across clients.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model and Algorithm Configuration:</strong> The experiments employ ResNet18 as the baseline architecture for comparison, which has 11 million parameters. FedNAS, on the other hand, uses an 8-layer DARTS cell structure with 4 million parameters. The local search algorithm, MiLeNAS, is utilized with a mixed-level optimization technique to efficiently search for optimal architectures and weights.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Training and Evaluation:</strong> The experiments are conducted in both cross-silo and cross-device settings, with different numbers of clients and rounds. The server and clients communicate through a distributed training system built for FedNAS. The performance of the models is evaluated based on the average validation accuracy across all clients, and the results are compared with local adaptation via FedAvg, Ditto, and perFedAvg.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Experimental Results:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Personalized Model Search:</strong> FedNAS demonstrates superior performance in the personalized model search experiments. It achieves an average validation accuracy of 91.3% for label skew distribution, which is 5% higher than local adaptation and 2% higher than the Ditto method. The results also show that FedNAS can outperform other methods in most client setups, with some improvements as high as 15% compared to perFedAvg.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330171257843.png"></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Global Model Search:</strong> When searching for a global model, FedNAS outperforms the FedAvg algorithm running on DenseNet. The architecture searched by FedNAS achieves a 4% higher test accuracy than FedAvg on the non-IID dataset, confirming the efficacy of FedNAS in finding models that are better suited for heterogeneous data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>System Efficiency:</strong> The efficiency comparison reveals that FedNAS can find better architectures with fewer parameters in less time compared to FedAvg. The distributed version of FedNAS takes less than 5 hours to complete, while the single-process version takes 33 hours, highlighting the practicality of FedNAS for real-world deployment.</p>

    <title>FBNet: Hardware-Aware Efficient ConvNet Design via Differentiable Neural Architecture Search</title>
    <url>/2020/02/03/Fbnet/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Wu_FBNet_Hardware-Aware_Efficient_ConvNet_Design_via_Differentiable_Neural_Architecture_Search_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf">paper <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>The rapid advancement of mobile devices has led to an increasing demand for efficient and accurate neural networks that can operate on limited computational resources. Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are the backbone of many computer vision applications, but their deployment on mobile devices is often hindered by their computational complexity and latency. Traditional neural architecture search (NAS) methods are computationally expensive and do not always translate to practical efficiency gains on actual hardware.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330161109207.png" alt="image-20240330161109207"></p>
<p>FBNet addresses this challenge by introducing a novel differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) framework, which is hardware-aware and focuses on optimizing ConvNets for mobile devices. The key motivation behind this research is to bridge the gap between the theoretical efficiency of NAS methods and their practical application on real-world devices. By considering the hardware-specific characteristics, such as input resolution and processing power, FBNet aims to discover efficient ConvNet architectures that not only reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) but also improve latency, which is critical for mobile applications.</p>
<p>The paper proposes a layer-wise search space, where each layer of the network can choose from a set of predefined blocks, allowing for a more tailored architecture that adapts to the target device’s capabilities. The use of gradient-based optimization and the Gumbel Softmax technique enables the efficient exploration of this vast search space, leading to the discovery of FBNets that outperform existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This research represents a significant step forward in the design of mobile-friendly ConvNets and has important implications for the future of on-device machine learning applications.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>The paper presents several groundbreaking contributions to the field of mobile neural network design. Firstly, it introduces FBNet, a family of efficient ConvNets that are meticulously optimized for mobile devices using a hardware-aware approach. Through the Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) framework, the authors are able to sidestep the computationally intensive nature of traditional NAS methods, significantly reducing the search cost while achieving superior performance.</p>
<p>A key contribution is the layer-wise search space that allows for individual optimization of each network layer, leading to architectures that are not only computationally efficient but also tailored to the specific constraints of mobile hardware. The use of the Gumbel Softmax technique enables gradient-based optimization of the architecture distribution, making the search process for optimal network configurations extremely fast and scalable.</p>
<p>Moreover, the paper proposes a latency-aware loss function that directly incorporates the actual latency on target devices into the training objective. This novel approach ensures that the discovered architectures are not only accurate but also operate with minimal delay, which is crucial for real-time mobile applications.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors demonstrate the versatility of their approach by searching for and optimizing FBNets across different input resolutions and channel sizes, as well as different target devices, showcasing the adaptability and robustness of their method. The open-sourcing of FBNet models further enhances the paper’s contribution, making these state-of-the-art, efficient ConvNets accessible to the broader research community and promoting further advancements in mobile deep learning.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The methodology at the core of the FBNet paper revolves around the Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) framework, which is designed to efficiently discover hardware-aware ConvNet architectures for mobile devices. The key innovation lies in the layer-wise search space and the use of gradient-based optimization techniques, which allow for a much faster and more targeted search process compared to traditional reinforcement learning-based NAS methods.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330162531306.png" alt="image-20240330162531306"></p>
<p><strong>Layer-Wise Search Space:</strong> The authors propose a search space where each layer of the ConvNet can independently select a different building block or operator. This approach is in contrast to prior works that often reuse the same cell structure across all layers. The layer-wise search space is defined by a macro-architecture that specifies the number of layers and their input/output dimensions, while the type of block for each layer is determined through the search process. This flexibility enables the discovery of architectures that can adapt to the varying computational demands at different stages of the network.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330162617949.png" alt="image-20240330162617949"></p>
<p><strong>Block Structures and Operators:</strong> The building blocks within the search space are inspired by successful architectures like MobileNetV2 and ShiftNet. They consist of a series of point-wise (1x1) convolutions, depthwise (KxK) convolutions with varying kernel sizes (K), and expansion ratios (e), which control the growth of the network’s channel dimensions. The blocks also incorporate group convolutions and channel shuffle operations to further enhance efficiency. A unique “skip” block is included, which allows the network to skip computation-heavy layers and effectively control depth.</p>

<p><strong>Latency-Aware Loss Function:</strong> A critical component of the methodology is the loss function used during the search and training process. The authors define a loss function that includes both cross-entropy loss for accuracy and a latency loss term that penalizes architectures based on their runtime on the target device. This latency is measured in microseconds and incorporated into the loss through a lookup table model, which estimates the overall latency by summing the latencies of individual operators. This model ensures that the latency term is differentiable, allowing for gradient-based optimizations.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330162745106.png" alt="image-20240330162745106"></p>

<p><strong>Gumbel Softmax and Gradient-Based Optimization:</strong> To efficiently explore the vast search space, the authors utilize the Gumbel Softmax distribution to relax the discrete sampling of architectures into a continuous relaxation. This technique enables the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the architecture distribution parameters, turning the search for optimal architectures into a training problem. The Gumbel Softmax function, controlled by a temperature parameter, allows for the gradients to flow through the sampling process, effectively training the network to preferentially sample architectures that balance accuracy and latency.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient Super Net Training:</strong> The DNAS framework represents the search space as a “super net” with multiple parallel blocks at each layer. During training, the super net is optimized by updating the weights of each operator and the sampling probabilities for each block. The latter is achieved by updating the parameters of the Gumbel Softmax distribution. Once the training is complete, the optimal architectures are sampled from the learned distribution.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330163209255.png" alt="image-20240330163209255"></p>
<p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong> The authors conduct a series of experiments using the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset, a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of ConvNets. The search process begins with the construction of a latency lookup table for the target device, a Samsung Galaxy S8 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 platform. This table is crucial for the latency-aware loss function, providing accurate measurements of operator runtimes.</p>
<p>The search space is defined by a macro-architecture with 22 layers, where each layer can choose from 9 candidate blocks, resulting in approximately 10^21 possible architectures. The DNAS framework is then used to train a stochastic super net, which contains parallel instances of these blocks at each layer. The training process involves optimizing the weights of each operator and the architecture distribution parameters using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the Adam optimizer.</p>
<p>To reduce training time and computational cost, the authors randomly select 100 classes from the 1000-class dataset and train the super net for 90 epochs. The input resolution is set to 224x224, and the training is performed with Caffe2’s int8 inference engine, which is optimized for mobile devices.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330163309240.png" alt="image-20240330163309240"></p>
<p><strong>Experimental Results:</strong> The results of the experiments are highly promising. FBNet-B, one of the models discovered by DNAS, achieves a top-1 accuracy of 74.1% on ImageNet with 295M FLOPs and a latency of 23.1 ms on a Samsung S8 phone. This represents a significant improvement over MobileNetV2-1.3, which has similar accuracy but requires 2.4x more FLOPs and 1.5x more latency. Furthermore, FBNet-B’s search cost is estimated to be 420x smaller than that of MnasNet, a state-of-the-art model designed using a different NAS approach.</p>
<p>The paper also presents results for different input resolutions and channel scalings, showing that FBNets can achieve 1.5% to 6.4% higher accuracy than MobileNetV2 under these conditions. The smallest FBNet model, optimized for a Samsung S8, achieves 50.2% accuracy with a latency of just 2.9 ms (345 frames per second), demonstrating the potential for real-time applications.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors perform searches targeting two different mobile devices, the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the iPhone X, and compare the performance of the resulting models. The results highlight the importance of device-specific optimizations, as the FBNet model optimized for the iPhone X shows a 1.4x speedup on that device compared to the Samsung-optimized model.</p>
<p>Overall, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DNAS framework in discovering efficient and accurate ConvNets for mobile devices. The significant improvements in both accuracy and latency, along with the low search costs, make FBNets a compelling choice for deploying computer vision models on mobile platforms. The paper’s findings pave the way for future research in efficient neural network design and its practical application in resource-constrained environments.</p>

    <url>/2020/01/12/Nasnet/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Zoph_Learning_Transferable_Architectures_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>In the realm of deep learning, designing efficient and effective neural network architectures for image classification has been a challenging task that often requires extensive manual tuning and expertise. Traditional approaches to architecture engineering are not only time-consuming but also limited by human creativity and intuition. With the increasing size and complexity of datasets like ImageNet, the need for automated architecture design becomes more pressing to harness the full potential of available data.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this research is to address the computational constraints and manual effort involved in architecture engineering by introducing an automated approach to learning transferable neural network architectures. The goal is to develop a method that can discover efficient convolutional building blocks from a smaller dataset and transfer them to larger datasets, such as ImageNet, with minimal modifications. This transferability is crucial as it allows the learned architectures to adapt and perform well across various image recognition tasks without extensive retraining or redesign.</p>
<p>The research leverages the concept of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to explore a vast space of possible architectures and identify those that generalize well beyond the dataset they were discovered on. By focusing on the design of a novel search space and a new regularization technique, the study aims to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing computational demands, thus making neural networks more accessible and efficient for a broader range of applications. The ultimate aim is to push the boundaries of what is possible in image classification by automating the process of architecture design and demonstrating the potential for significant performance improvements over human-engineered models.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190801124.png" alt="image-20240330190801124"></p>
<p>This research makes several significant contributions to the field of neural network architecture design. Firstly, it introduces a novel search space, known as the “NASNet search space,” which is specifically designed to enable transferability of learned architectures across different datasets and computational scales. This space is crafted to ensure that the complexity of the architecture is independent of the network’s depth and input image size, allowing for scalability and adaptability.</p>
<p>Secondly, the paper presents a method for learning convolutional cells, or “building blocks,” on a small dataset and transferring them to larger datasets, such as ImageNet. This approach significantly accelerates the search process and demonstrates that architectures discovered on smaller datasets can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when transferred to larger ones, without extensive re-engineering.</p>
<p>Additionally, the research introduces a new regularization technique, “ScheduledDropPath,” which improves the generalization capabilities of the models. This technique involves dropping out paths in the network with a probability that increases linearly over the training period, leading to better performance and regularization compared to existing methods.</p>
<p>Finally, the study shows that the learned features from the image classification models are generically useful and can be transferred to other computer vision tasks, such as object detection. By combining the learned features with existing frameworks like Faster-RCNN, the research achieves state-of-the-art results in object detection tasks, further highlighting the versatility and utility of the proposed methods. Overall, these contributions pave the way for more efficient and effective neural network design, with potential applications across various domains of artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The methodology at the core of this research revolves around the concept of Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which is used to automate the process of discovering efficient and effective convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The process is divided into several key steps that culminate in the development of a transferable and scalable CNN architecture.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190822005.png" alt="image-20240330190822005"></p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190839919.png" alt="image-20240330190839919"></p>
<p><strong>1. Designing the NASNet Search Space:</strong><br>The initial step involves the creation of a novel search space, termed the NASNet search space. This space is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing the complexity of the architecture to be decoupled from the network’s depth and the size of the input images. The search space is composed of convolutional layers, referred to as “cells,” which have identical structures but different weights. The goal is to find the optimal cell structure that can be stacked together to form a complete network, with each cell having its own set of parameters.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190829414.png" alt="image-20240330190829414"></p>
<p><strong>2. Searching for Optimal Cells on a Small Dataset:</strong><br>The next phase is the search for the best convolutional cell on a smaller dataset, such as CIFAR-10. This is done using a controller recurrent neural network (RNN) that samples child networks with different architectures. These child networks are trained to convergence on the validation set, and their accuracies are used to update the controller. The controller RNN is optimized using policy gradient methods, which adjust the probabilities of sampling certain architectures over time to favor those that perform well.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190851048.png" alt="image-20240330190851048"></p>
<p><strong>3. Transferring the Learned Architecture to Larger Datasets:</strong><br>Once the best cell is identified on the small dataset, it is transferred to a larger dataset like ImageNet. This transfer is made possible by the design of the NASNet search space, which ensures that the complexity of the architecture is independent of the input image size. The best cell is simply stacked multiple times, with each copy having its own parameters, to create a deep convolutional architecture suitable for ImageNet.</p>
<p><strong>4. Introduction of ScheduledDropPath Regularization:</strong><br>To improve the generalization of the models, the paper introduces ScheduledDropPath, a regularization technique that involves stochastically dropping out paths within the cells during training. Unlike traditional dropout methods, ScheduledDropPath increases the probability of dropping out a path linearly over the course of training. This dynamic scheduling helps the model to learn more robust features that are less likely to overfit to the training data.</p>
<p><strong>5. Training and Evaluation:</strong><br>The final step involves training the complete architecture on the target dataset using standard practices such as data augmentation, cosine learning rate scheduling, and optimization techniques like SGD with momentum. The model is evaluated on the validation set to determine its accuracy and compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p>The experimental setup in this research is meticulously designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to benchmark its performance against existing state-of-the-art models. The experiments are conducted in a structured manner, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the newly introduced NASNet architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong> The initial phase of the experiments involves searching for the optimal convolutional cell on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a smaller yet challenging image classification dataset. This search is performed using a controller RNN with a one-layer LSTM configuration, which is responsible for sampling child networks with varying architectures. The child networks are trained using standard training procedures, and their performance on a validation set is utilized to update the controller RNN. The search process is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that encourages exploration and expedites convergence.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190917473.png" alt="image-20240330190917473"></p>
<p>To ensure the robustness of the discovered architectures, the experiments incorporate ScheduledDropPath, a novel regularization technique. This method stochastically drops out paths in the convolutional cells during training, with the dropout probability increasing linearly over time. The overall architecture is then evaluated on the CIFAR-10 test set to identify the top-performing cells.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190934116.png" alt="image-20240330190934116"></p>
<p><strong>Transfer to Larger Datasets:</strong> Once the best convolutional cell is identified on CIFAR-10, the researchers transfer this architecture to the larger ImageNet dataset. This transfer is facilitated by the scalable nature of the NASNet search space, which allows the convolutional cell to be stacked multiple times to form a deep network suitable for ImageNet. The transferred architecture is trained from scratch on ImageNet using similar procedures as before, with the addition of data augmentation techniques to further enhance generalization.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190942986.png" alt="image-20240330190942986"></p>
<p><strong>Experimental Results:</strong> The experimental results are highly promising and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, the NASNet architecture achieves a state-of-the-art error rate of 2.4%, showcasing its ability to generalize from a smaller dataset to a more complex one.</p>
<p>The results on ImageNet are equally impressive. Despite not being searched directly on ImageNet, the NASNet architecture, when transferred, achieves a top-1 accuracy of 82.7% and a top-5 accuracy of 96.2%, outperforming human-engineered architectures. This performance is achieved while using 9 billion fewer FLOPS, representing a 28% reduction in computational demand compared to the previous state-of-the-art model.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the NASNet architecture exhibits excellent scalability. By varying the number of convolutional cells and filters, the researchers create a family of NASNet models that outperform equivalent human-designed models at various computational budgets. Even a smaller version of NASNet achieves a top-1 accuracy of 74% on ImageNet, which is 3.1% better than similarly-sized state-of-the-art models.</p>
<p>In addition to image classification, the learned features from NASNet are shown to be generically useful and transferable to other computer vision tasks. When combined with the Faster-RCNN framework for object detection, NASNet surpasses state-of-the-art results by a significant 4.0%, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 43.1% on the COCO dataset.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02877.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330173945735.png" alt="image-20240330173945735"></p>
<p>The rapid evolution of mobile technology has led to an increasing demand for sophisticated applications capable of advanced tasks such as image classification, while maintaining optimal performance and efficiency. However, the deployment of complex machine learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) on mobile devices is often hindered by the limited computational resources and strict latency requirements of these platforms. This has sparked a need for hardware-efficient ConvNets that can deliver high accuracy without compromising on speed.</p>
<p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the design of ConvNets, offering the potential to explore a vast design space to find optimal network architectures. Despite its promise, traditional NAS methods are often computationally expensive, requiring significant GPU hours to search through the multitude of possible architectures, making it impractical for widespread use.</p>
<p>Recognizing these challenges, the research community has been driven to develop more efficient NAS methods that can significantly reduce the search time. The goal is to design ConvNets that not only meet the accuracy and latency criteria for mobile devices but also minimize the computational overhead of the search process. By doing so, researchers aim to democratize the use of NAS, enabling a broader range of applications and promoting further innovation in mobile artificial intelligence. This pursuit has led to the exploration of novel NAS techniques that leverage differentiable search methods, aiming to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance, and ultimately, to unlock the full potential of mobile AI.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>This research makes several pivotal contributions to the field of efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for mobile devices. Firstly, it introduces a novel single-path search space that dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to traditional multi-path NAS methods. This innovation allows for a more streamlined and efficient search process, which is crucial for deploying ConvNets on hardware with limited resources.</p>
<p>Secondly, the method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet dataset while maintaining a latency suitable for mobile devices. This accomplishment demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively balance the trade-off between performance and efficiency, a common challenge in mobile AI applications.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the research significantly improves the efficiency of the NAS process, reducing the search cost by up to 5,000 times compared to prior work. By completing the search in merely eight epochs, the method makes NAS more practical and accessible, potentially enabling broader adoption in the development of mobile applications.</p>
<p>Lastly, the authors prioritize reproducibility by open-sourcing the entire codebase, which not only allows others to verify the results but also encourages further research and development in the area of hardware-aware NAS. This transparent approach fosters a collaborative environment and paves the way for future advancements in the field. Overall, these contributions represent a significant leap towards realizing the full potential of mobile AI through the efficient design of ConvNets.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330174155827.png" alt="image-20240330174155827"></p>
<p>The methodology introduced in this research is a novel approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that focuses on designing hardware-efficient Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) suitable for mobile devices. The core innovation is the Single-Path NAS, a differentiable NAS method that significantly reduces the search time while maintaining high accuracy and adherence to latency constraints.</p>
<p>At the heart of Single-Path NAS is the concept of a single-path search space, which contrasts with previous methods that often employed multi-path supernets. Instead of exploring numerous distinct architectures, Single-Path NAS uses a single, over-parameterized ConvNet where all architectural decisions are encoded with shared convolutional kernel parameters. This paradigm shift reduces the number of trainable parameters, leading to a substantial decrease in search cost.</p>
<p>The method operates by searching over an over-parameterized “superkernel” in each ConvNet layer. This superkernel contains the weights for all candidate convolutional operations, allowing the search to be framed as identifying the appropriate subset of kernel weights to use. By sharing the convolutional kernel weights across different architectural options, the method avoids the need to maintain separate paths for each candidate operation, which is a common practice in multi-path NAS methods.</p>
<p>A critical component of Single-Path NAS is the use of a hardware-aware objective function that incorporates an accurate inference latency model. This model predicts the runtime of the ConvNets on the target mobile platform, allowing the search to optimize for both accuracy and efficiency. The objective function is designed to be differentiable, ensuring that gradients can be computed efficiently during the search process.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330175957878.png" alt="image-20240330175957878"></p>
<p>The Single-Path NAS methodology leverages a one-shot NAS formulation, where the search is conducted over a single, compact neural network rather than a bi-level optimization problem. This formulation eliminates the need for separate gradient steps between the ConvNet weights and the NAS parameters, simplifying the training process and further reducing the search time.</p>
<p>The research also introduces a reproducibility aspect by open-sourcing the entire codebase, enabling other researchers and practitioners to reproduce the results and build upon the methodology. This openness fosters collaboration and accelerates the advancement of NAS techniques for mobile devices.</p>
<p>In summary, the Single-Path NAS method represents a significant leap forward in the field of NAS, particularly for mobile applications. By streamlining the search process and reducing the computational demands, it makes the design of hardware-efficient ConvNets more accessible and practical. The method’s focus on accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility sets a new standard for future research in this domain.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330180022085.png" alt="image-20240330180022085"></p>
<p>The experimental setup of this research is meticulously designed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method in the context of mobile device deployment. The primary dataset utilized is the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale collection of images widely recognized for benchmarking image classification models. The target platform for the ConvNets designed through the method is the Pixel 1 smartphone, representative of real-world mobile devices.</p>
<p>The method’s implementation leverages TensorFlow and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are specialized hardware accelerators for machine learning workloads. All models are deployed using TensorFlow TFLite, ensuring compatibility with the mobile platform. Runtime profiling is conducted using the Facebook AI Performance Evaluation Platform (FAI-PEP), which provides detailed per-layer runtime breakdowns, essential for latency-sensitive applications.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330180835451.png" alt="image-20240330180835451"></p>
<p>The experimental results are nothing short of impressive. The proposed method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 74.96% on ImageNet, with an inference latency of just 79ms on the Pixel 1 phone. This performance is not only state-of-the-art among hardware-efficient NAS methods but also maintains a target latency of 80ms, as per the experimental constraints.</p>
<p>In terms of search efficiency, the method requires only eight epochs to reach its peak performance, which translates to a mere 3.75 hours of wall-clock time on a TPUv2. This represents a staggering improvement over previous NAS methods, which could take weeks of computational time. Specifically, the method is up to 5,000 times faster in search cost compared to existing approaches, making it a groundbreaking advancement in the realm of NAS.</p>
<p>The research also includes an ablation study to understand the impact of kernel-weight subsets on the accuracy and efficiency trade-off. The findings suggest that training over subsets of kernel weights can effectively capture similar accuracy-runtime trade-offs as individually trained kernels, highlighting the flexibility and adaptability of the proposed method.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the method’s runtime model is validated for accuracy, with an average prediction error of just 1.76%, indicating its reliability in estimating the performance of the designed ConvNets.</p>

    <title>BlockQNN: Efficient Block-wise Neural Network Architecture Generation</title>
    <url>/2020/01/30/blockqnn/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05584.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05584.pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>In the realm of computer vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success, with hand-crafted architectures like AlexNet, VGG, Inception, and ResNet significantly advancing the state-of-the-art. However, the design of these networks relies heavily on expert knowledge and is often a labor-intensive process. The exponential growth of network configurations due to the increasing depth and complexity has made manual design not only challenging but also infeasible, as it involves a tremendous search space and computational costs.</p>
<p>The paper “BlockQNN: Efficient Block-wise Neural Network Architecture Generation” addresses this challenge by proposing an automated approach to network architecture design. The authors introduce BlockQNN, a method that leverages the Q-Learning paradigm with an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy to efficiently generate high-performance network blocks. These blocks are then stacked to construct the entire network, which not only reduces the search space but also accelerates the generation process.</p>
<p>The motivation behind BlockQNN is to democratize the design of neural network architectures by eliminating the need for extensive manual tuning and expertise. By automating the process, BlockQNN aims to make it accessible for a broader range of researchers and practitioners to develop state-of-the-art models, even with limited computational resources. The paper highlights the potential of automated network design to discover novel architectures that are both efficient and effective, paving the way for future advancements in deep learning.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330152346495.png" alt="image-20240330152346495"></p>
<p>The paper makes several significant contributions to the field of automated neural network design. Firstly, it introduces a novel block-wise network generation approach that constructs high-performance networks by sequentially selecting component layers through a learning agent trained with Q-Learning. This method yields state-of-the-art results, achieving a 2.35% top-1 error rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and competitive accuracy on the larger-scale ImageNet dataset.</p>
<p>Secondly, BlockQNN dramatically reduces the search space and computational costs associated with network design. The paper demonstrates that a high-performing network can be generated with only 32 GPUs in 3 days, which is a significant improvement over previous methods that required hundreds of GPUs and weeks of training time.</p>
<p>Additionally, the paper presents a distributed asynchronous framework and an early stop strategy to further accelerate the generation process. This allows for efficient search with fast convergence, making the method more practical for researchers with limited resources.</p>
<p>Another key contribution is the introduction of a reward function that correlates the accuracy of early-stopped networks with their final performance, enabling the selection of good blocks in reduced training time.</p>
<p>Lastly, the paper explores the transferability of the generated networks, showing that a network optimized for CIFAR can be transferred to ImageNet with minimal modifications and still achieve outstanding performance. This highlights the generalizability of BlockQNN and its potential for application across various datasets and tasks. Overall, BlockQNN represents a significant step forward in making neural network architecture generation more accessible and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The BlockQNN framework is built upon the concept of generating networks in a block-wise fashion. Instead of designing each layer individually, the authors propose constructing networks by stacking optimized blocks, which are generated by the learning agent through a process known as epsilon-greedy exploration. This strategy starts with a high probability of exploration (epsilon) and gradually reduces it to favor exploitation of known, high-performing block structures.</p>
<p>To further enhance the efficiency of the network generation process, the authors introduce a distributed asynchronous framework. This setup allows for parallel training of multiple network blocks across different compute nodes, significantly speeding up the search for optimal block structures.</p>

<p>An early stopping strategy is also implemented to curtail training once a certain performance threshold is met, saving computational resources and time. This strategy is underpinned by a carefully designed reward function that positively correlates the early-stopped network’s accuracy with its final performance, ensuring that the agent can identify effective blocks even when training is halted prematurely.</p>

<p>Additionally, the paper explores the use of layer embedding and recurrent networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, to aggregate information from individual layers into an overall network representation. This representation is then fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict network performance before extensive training, further optimizing the search process.</p>
<p>The authors also experiment with different block connection styles, finding that simply stacking blocks sequentially may not be optimal. They propose an automated method for determining the best way to connect blocks, which can enhance network performance by combining features across multiple resolutions.</p>
<p>Overall, the methods employed in the BlockQNN paper represent a significant advancement in the field of neural architecture generation, offering a more efficient and effective approach to designing high-performing neural networks.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330155122058.png" alt="image-20240330155122058"></p>
<p>One of the primary achievements of BlockQNN is its ability to generate networks that rival the performance of hand-crafted architectures. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, the best network generated by BlockQNN achieved a top-1 error rate of 2.35%, which is on par with, if not better than, several state-of-the-art hand-crafted networks. This demonstrates that the block-wise generation strategy and the learning agent’s ability to select optimal components layers are highly effective.</p>

<p>The efficiency of BlockQNN was also a key focus, with the authors reporting that the entire process of network generation, from random exploration to exploitation, could be completed in just 3 days using 32 GPUs. This is a significant reduction in time and resources compared to other methods such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which can take weeks and hundreds of GPUs.</p>
<p>The transferability of the networks generated by BlockQNN was another aspect explored in the experiments. The authors transferred the best block structure found on the CIFAR-10 dataset to the more challenging ImageNet dataset. Despite the increase in complexity and the difference in input image sizes, the transferred network still achieved competitive accuracy, with a top-1 error rate of 18.00% and a top-5 error rate of 4.58% when trained on 224x224 images and tested on 320x320 images. This underscores the generalization capabilities of the block structures discovered by BlockQNN.</p>
<p>The paper also presents results from the Faster BlockQNN approach, which aims to predict network performance before training. This method was able to achieve comparable results with only 1 GPU in 20 hours on the CIFAR-10 dataset, making it an extremely cost-effective solution for researchers with limited computational resources.</p>
<p>In addition to these benchmarks, the authors analyzed the evolutionary process of the auto-generated blocks, observing a transition from simpler structures during the exploration phase to more complex, multi-branch structures in the exploitation phase. This suggests that the learning agent is effectively learning to construct more sophisticated network blocks as it gains more experience.</p>

<h2 id="Basic-concepts"><a href="#Basic-concepts" class="headerlink" title="Basic concepts"></a>Basic concepts</h2><p>Element-wise operations represent the most fundamental and straightforward category of kernel functions. Their computational characteristics align seamlessly with the working style of GPUs: they perform individual arithmetic operations on each element and then output the results directly. Despite their simplicity, many operators in the field of deep learning fall into this category. Common examples include Add, Mul, Concat, various activation functions like Sigmoid and ReLU along with their variants, and normalization techniques such as BatchNorm.</p>

<p>Here, it’s important to note that if vectorized memory access with float4 is used, the number of threads needs to be reduced to a quarter of the original. Whether the block size or the grid size should be reduced to a quarter depends on the actual data scale and should be determined through empirical testing.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>When using cuda events to measure elapsed time, run 1000 iterations and take the average. When running with nsight compute, run it only once.</li>
<li>If the data significantly deviates from theoretical expectations, consider whether other people/processes are also using the GPU, which could lead to inaccurate timing measurements.</li>
<li>For all experiments below, set the block size to 128.</li>
</ol>
<p>For a data scale of N=32×1024×1024 <em>N</em>=32×1024×1024, the following experimental data is obtained (data may fluctuate; if the discrepancy is particularly large, rerun ncu):</p>

</ol>
<p>Conclusion: In the case of small data scales, the optimization method of vectorized memory access does not need to be considered. For large data scales, it is advisable to consider using vectorized memory access to avoid affecting Occupancy. The same approach is taken in the following official blog:</p>
<p><a class="link" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-pro-tip-increase-performance-with-vectorized-memory-access/">CUDA Pro Tip: Increase Performance with Vectorized Memory Access | NVIDIA Technical Blog <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>In situations where the performance is not limited by latency, the principle behind the performance enhancement of float4 vectorized memory access is as follows:</p>
<p>GPUs do not have features like AVX-512 in CPUs, which can process multiple data elements with a single instruction. The performance improvement of float4 mainly lies in the reduction of memory access instructions (for the same data scale, it previously required four instructions, but now only a quarter of the instructions are needed). This allows more instructions to be stored in the instruction cache, thereby increasing the hit rate of the instruction cache.</p>
<p>To determine whether vectorized memory access has been utilized, one should look at the generated SASS code to see if there are instructions like LDG.E.128 Rx, [Rx.64] or STG.E.128 [R6.64], Rx present. The existence of these instructions indicates successful vectorization; their absence indicates a failure in vectorization.</p>

<h2 id="Basic-Concepts"><a href="#Basic-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Basic Concepts"></a>Basic Concepts</h2><p>Reduction problems are a common category of questions encountered in interviews. Compared to elementwise problems, where each thread independently performs tasks, reduction problems become more complex due to the involvement of synchronization and communication between threads. Additionally, these problems can leverage the previously introduced optimization techniques for vectorized memory access, which adds a layer of complexity in terms of thought process.<br>The <code>reductions.cu</code> file primarily implements the following three kernel functions for reduction summation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The most basic <code>atomic_reduction()</code>, which extensively utilizes the <code>atomicAdd()</code> function.</li>
<li>The sweep style reduction sum <code>reduction_a()</code>, which calls <code>atomicAdd</code> once at the end.</li>
<li>The warp shuffle reduction <code>reduction_ws()</code>, which also calls <code>atomicAdd</code> once at the end.</li>
</ol>

<p>Theory: The <code>atomic_reduction()</code> is the slowest because it heavily relies on the <code>atomicAdd()</code> function. Compared to <code>reduction_a</code>, <code>reduction_ws</code> tends to perform better due to its minimal use of shared memory.</p>

<li>As the data size increases, the performance advantage of <code>reduce_ws</code> over <code>reduction_a</code> diminishes.</li>
<li>The use of the <code>atomicAdd</code> function affects the Memory utilization rate, and this impact does not vary with the scale of the data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the first point: Both <code>reduce_ws</code> and <code>reduction_a</code> require loading data within a grid-stride loop initially. As the data size grows, the time taken to load the data becomes the dominant factor in the overall time consumption. At this juncture, the specific method of performing reduction matters less, hence the time difference narrows with increasing data sizes. In theory, warp shuffle should offer better performance than the classic reduction sum, but in practice, it still depends on the specific data scale of the problem at hand and requires a detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point: The impact of the <code>atomicAdd</code> function on performance is significant because it can reduce the Memory utilization rate to a very low level, and this is difficult to improve by simply changing the data scale.</p>

    <title> DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search</title>
    <url>/2020/01/28/darts/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Liu H, Simonyan K, Yang Y. Darts: Differentiable architecture search[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.09055, 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>The quest for state-of-the-art neural network architectures has traditionally demanded substantial human expertise and computational resources. The manual process of architecture design has been a bottleneck, prompting the development of automated algorithmic solutions. While these have achieved competitive performance, existing architecture search algorithms like reinforcement learning (RL) and evolution are computationally intensive, often requiring thousands of GPU days. This has led to an inherent scalability challenge, as the search is treated as a black-box optimization problem over a discrete domain, necessitating a large number of architecture evaluations. The drive to overcome these limitations and the desire to automate the design process with increased efficiency and reduced computational costs have been the key motivators behind the development of the DARTS method.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>DARTS (Differentiable ARchiTecture Search) revolutionizes the field by formulating architecture search as a differentiable problem, enabling the use of gradient descent for optimization. This novel algorithm is based on bilevel optimization and is applicable to both convolutional and recurrent architectures. DARTS stands out by matching or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art methods while using orders of magnitude less computation resources. It also outperforms ENAS, another efficient architecture search method, by discovering cells with comparable error rates but fewer parameters. Furthermore, DARTS demonstrates the transferability of learned architectures from CIFAR-10 and PTB to ImageNet and WikiText-2, respectively, showcasing its versatility and robustness.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330012026177.png" alt="image-20240330012026177"></p>
<p>DARTS represents the computation procedure of an architecture as a directed acyclic graph, with nodes as latent representations and edges as operations. By relaxing the categorical choice of operations to a softmax distribution, the architecture search is reduced to learning a set of continuous variables. DARTS employs a bilevel optimization strategy to jointly optimize the architecture and its weights, using gradient descent to minimize validation loss. An approximation technique is introduced to manage computational complexity, leading to an iterative process that converges to a final architecture.</p>

<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330012253806.png" alt="image-20240330012253806"></p>
<p>The paper’s experiments are conducted on four datasets: CIFAR-10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and WikiText-2. The goal is to discover high-performance convolutional architectures for image classification and recurrent architectures for language modeling. The experiments are divided into two main phases: architecture search and architecture evaluation.</p>
<p>During the architecture search phase, the authors use DARTS to explore the space of possible network architectures. They define the search space based on a set of candidate operations, such as convolutions, pooling, and linear transformations, and allow the algorithm to learn the optimal combination of these operations. The search process is efficient due to the continuous relaxation of the architecture representation, which enables the use of gradient descent for optimization.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330012324666.png" alt="image-20240330012324666"></p>
<p>In the architecture evaluation phase, the authors construct larger networks using the best cells found during the search phase. These networks are trained from scratch on the test sets to evaluate their performance. The authors report that DARTS is able to identify a convolutional cell that achieves a test error of 2.76 ± 0.09% on CIFAR-10, which is competitive with state-of-the-art results obtained using significantly more computational resources. Similarly, for language modeling, DARTS discovers a recurrent cell that achieves a test perplexity of 55.7 on Penn Treebank, outperforming both manually tuned LSTMs and other automatically discovered cells.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330012701560.png" alt="image-20240330012701560"></p>
<p>One of the key findings is the transferability of the architectures learned by DARTS. The authors demonstrate that a convolutional cell learned on CIFAR-10 can be transferred to ImageNet with competitive performance, and a recurrent cell learned on Penn Treebank can be transferred to WikiText-2. This transferability is crucial as it shows the versatility of DARTS in discovering architectures that are not only optimal for a specific dataset but also generalizable to other tasks.</p>
<p>The authors also compare DARTS with existing state-of-the-art methods, such as NASNet, AmoebaNet, and ENAS. The results show that DARTS can match or even outperform these methods while using orders of magnitude fewer computational resources. For instance, while NASNet required 2000 GPU days and AmoebaNet required 3150 GPU days to achieve state-of-the-art results, DARTS achieved comparable performance in just a few GPU days.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09426.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>In the realm of deep learning, designing efficient neural network architectures and compressing models for mobile deployment present significant challenges. Traditional approaches require extensive expertise and iterative trial-and-error, which is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. The advent of mobile devices with limited computational capabilities has further exacerbated the need for compact models that maintain high performance.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330185955896.png" alt="image-20240330185955896"></p>
<p>To address these issues, the paper introduces a unified framework that integrates neural architecture search (NAS) with model compression strategies, aiming to automate the discovery of compact, high-performing neural networks suitable for mobile platforms. By leveraging a multi-objective evolutionary search algorithm, the framework balances model size and accuracy, leading to the development of models that outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this research is to alleviate the burden on human experts and to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and real-world applications. By automating the process, the framework not only accelerates the development of neural networks but also paves the way for wider adoption of deep learning technologies across various mobile devices, despite their constrained resources.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>This research makes several pivotal contributions to the field of neural network optimization for mobile applications.

<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190012000.png" alt="image-20240330190012000" style="zoom:50%;">

<p>The methodology at the core of this research is an innovative integration of neural architecture search (NAS) and model quantization, designed to optimize the design of neural networks for mobile deployment. The approach is centered around a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the accuracy of neural networks while minimizing their size, thereby addressing the computational constraints of mobile devices.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190033602.png" alt="image-20240330190033602"></p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190049055.png" alt="image-20240330190049055"></p>
<p>The framework begins by defining a search space that encompasses both architectural choices and quantization policies. The architecture search space is inspired by existing NAS methods, utilizing a cell-based approach with Inception-like modules, including both normal and reduction cells. These cells are stacked in specific patterns to form the overall network structure. The quantization policy search space, on the other hand, focuses on determining the optimal bit allocation for each cell in the network, allowing for different layers to have varying levels of quantization based on their redundancy.</p>
<p>The evolutionary algorithm operates on a population of models, initializing them randomly and then iteratively improving them through selection, mutation, and training. During each iteration, a subset of the population is sampled, and their fitness, based on a multi-objective function, is evaluated. This function prioritizes accuracy but penalizes excessive model growth, ensuring that the search remains focused on compact models.</p>
<p>Mutation in the algorithm involves altering the architectural combinations and quantization bits, introducing diversity into the population and facilitating exploration of the search space. The models are then trained on a dataset, quantized according to their assigned policies, and evaluated on a validation set to measure their accuracy and size. The best-performing models are carried over to the next generation, while the least fit are discarded.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the methodology is its flexibility. It can be applied to existing networks, providing tailored quantization policies to enhance their performance on mobile devices. Furthermore, the joint search for architecture and quantization policies allows for the discovery of entirely new models, termed JASQNet and JASQNet-Small, which demonstrate competitive accuracy and significantly reduced size compared to existing methods.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190102680.png" alt="image-20240330190102680"></p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190216448.png" alt="image-20240330190216448"></p>

<p>The quantization process itself is meticulous, involving linear scaling of weight vectors, bucketing to manage magnitude imbalance, and rounding to the nearest quantization point. This attention to detail ensures that the compression of models does not come at the cost of significant accuracy loss.</p>
<p>The experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the methodology. The approach is tested on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with the resulting JASQNet models outperforming their counterparts in terms of error rates and model size. The method also proves capable of improving the performance of pre-trained networks like ResNet and MobileNet when applied with learned quantization policies.</p>
<p>In summary, the methodology presented in this research is a significant advancement in the field of neural network optimization. It offers a systematic and automated approach to designing and compressing neural networks for mobile applications, resulting in models that are both efficient and effective.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330185939879.png" alt="image-20240330185939879"></p>
<p>The experimental setup in this research is meticulously designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The experiments are divided into two main phases: first, the application of the method to existing networks to provide tailored quantization policies, and second, the joint search for architecture and quantization policies to discover new models.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, the method is applied to a variety of state-of-the-art networks, including ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The goal here is to demonstrate the ability of the method to enhance the performance of pre-trained models by learning optimal quantization policies. The networks are evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, and the results are compared against their non-quantized (float) counterparts as well as other quantization strategies, such as 2-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit models.</p>
<p>The second phase involves a joint search for architecture and quantization policies on the CIFAR-10 dataset, aiming to discover new models, referred to as JASQNet and JASQNet-Small. The search space is vast, combining the architectural choices and quantization levels, and the evolutionary algorithm is run for a number of iterations to allow for thorough exploration.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190120339.png" alt="image-20240330190120339"></p>
<p>The experimental results are highly promising. For existing networks, the method successfully improves accuracy and reduces model size. For instance, the quantized ResNet18 model achieves a higher accuracy than the float model while having significantly fewer parameters. Similarly, MobileNet-v1 and MobileNet-v2 see improvements in accuracy when applying the learned quantization policies, outperforming their 8-bit and float counterparts.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330190137729.png" alt="image-20240330190137729"></p>
<p>In the joint search experiments, the discovered JASQNet models demonstrate competitive accuracy on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, with JASQNet-Small showing particularly impressive results in terms of model size reduction. These models achieve lower error rates with smaller footprints compared to other methods that focus solely on architecture search. The JASQNet models also maintain a better balance between accuracy and size when compared to models resulting from only quantization search.</p>
<p>Overall, the experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in optimizing neural networks for mobile deployment. The method not only enhances existing models but also has the capability to discover new, efficient architectures that are well-suited for resource-constrained environments. These findings pave the way for more widespread adoption of deep learning on mobile platforms, potentially leading to advancements in various mobile-based applications.</p>

    <title>Real-time federated evolutionary neural architecture search</title>
    <url>/2021/10/02/fedevo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02793.pdf">pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>In the realm of machine learning, preserving user privacy has become paramount, leading to the development of federated learning. This distributed approach allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while keeping data local, thus enhancing privacy. However, federated learning faces challenges, particularly the high communication costs due to the transmission of large model parameters and the substantial computational resources required for training complex models like deep neural networks. These issues are further compounded when conducting neural architecture search (NAS) within a federated environment.</p>
<p>The traditional centralized NAS methods, which are often computationally intensive, are not ideal for federated learning due to their disregard for model size and computational efficiency. Moreover, techniques like transfer learning, which are common in NAS, may not be directly applicable to federated learning as they can lead to model divergence and increased communication overhead.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, there is a need for a real-time, federated NAS algorithm that can efficiently optimize model performance while minimizing communication and computational costs. This involves developing strategies that allow for the sampling and training of sub-models on a subset of clients, inheriting weights from a master model to avoid reinitialization, and aggregating these sub-models into a global model. The goal is to embed the evolutionary optimization process seamlessly within the federated learning rounds, thereby reducing the need for extensive computational resources and maintaining the privacy of user data. The proposed method aims to bridge the gap between the computational demands of NAS and the constraints of federated learning, paving the way for more efficient and privacy-aware machine learning applications.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>This work introduces a novel framework that addresses the critical challenges of integrating neural architecture search (NAS) with federated learning. The primary contributions are twofold:</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330183119853.png" alt="image-20240330183119853"></p>
<ol>
<li><p>A pioneering real-time evolutionary NAS method is proposed, which not only optimizes model performance but also significantly reduces local computational burden and communication overhead. This is achieved through an innovative double-sampling technique that transmits a randomly sampled sub-model from a master model to a subset of clients for training, without the need for reinitialization. This approach ensures that each local device trains only one sub-network per generation, thereby minimizing the upload of parameters and maintaining model performance stability.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330183203077.png"></p>
</li>
<li><p>An effective aggregation strategy is developed for updating the global model based on the sub-networks trained at each generation. This strategy leverages the inherited weights from the master model, accelerating convergence and avoiding performance deterioration due to random reinitialization. The proposed method is validated through extensive comparative studies, demonstrating its ability to produce models with competitive learning performance and computational efficiency, outperforming traditional offline evolutionary NAS methods by at least five times in terms of speed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These contributions represent a significant advancement in the field of federated learning and NAS, offering a practical solution for real-time, privacy-preserving optimization of neural network architectures.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>The methodology presented in this work is designed to tackle the intricate problem of conducting neural architecture search (NAS) within the constraints of federated learning. The approach is centered around a real-time evolutionary framework that optimizes model performance while reducing computational and communication costs. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the methodological components:</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330183231177.png" alt="image-20240330183231177"></p>
<p><strong>Double-Sampling Technique:</strong><br>The core innovation lies in the double-sampling technique, which is instrumental in minimizing the local computational payload and server-client communication. This technique involves two key steps: first, a sub-network is randomly sampled from a master model for each individual in the evolutionary population; second, a subset of clients is randomly selected for training these sub-networks. This randomization ensures that the computational load is evenly distributed and that each client trains a unique sub-network per generation, thus avoiding redundant computations.</p>
<p><strong>Master-Slave Communication Paradigm:</strong><br>The master model serves as the baseline from which sub-networks are derived. It is初始化 at the outset and then continuously updated throughout the evolutionary process. Client devices download the sub-network corresponding to their assigned individual and train it using their local data. The updated sub-networks are then uploaded back to the server, which aggregates them to refine the master model. This iterative process of downloading, training, and uploading is repeated across generations, embedding the NAS within the federated learning rounds.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330183239569.png" alt="image-20240330183239569"></p>
<p><strong>Inheritance of Weights:</strong><br>A critical aspect of this method is the inheritance of weights from the master model to the sub-networks. This eliminates the need to reinitialize model parameters, which is both time-consuming and can lead to performance degradation. Instead, the sub-networks benefit from the knowledge accumulated in the master model, allowing them to start training from a more informed point and thus converge faster.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregation Strategy:</strong><br>The aggregation strategy is tailored to the federated setting, where clients may sample different sub-networks for different individuals. The server must reconcile these partial updates into a coherent global model. This is achieved by selectively combining the parameters of the trained sub-networks based on their corresponding choice keys, which guide which parts of the master model are updated.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives and Evaluation:</strong><br>The framework optimizes two main objectives: the test error of the global model, reflecting its predictive performance, and the floating-point operations per second (FLOPs), indicative of the model’s computational efficiency. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), specifically NSGA-II, is employed to balance these objectives and guide the search towards a set of Pareto optimal solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Real-Time Optimization:</strong><br>The entire process is designed to be real-time, with each generation of the evolutionary algorithm aligning with a communication round in federated learning. This synchronization ensures that the NAS is not just efficient but also seamlessly integrated into the operational workflow of the federated learning system.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Experimental Setup:</strong> The experiments utilize a distributed system with varying numbers of clients to simulate a federated learning scenario. The master model is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with a maximum of 26 hidden layers, ensuring that communication costs are kept to a minimum. The dataset used for training and testing is Cifar10, a standard benchmark for image recognition tasks, which consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 testing 32x32 RGB images across 10 different classes.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330183257102.png" alt="image-20240330183257102"></p>
<p>The federated learning process is configured with different client participation ratios and communication rounds, which are equivalent to the number of generations in the evolutionary algorithm. Each client’s local model parameters are updated using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and the server aggregates these updates to form the global model. The batch normalization layers within the master model are modified to disable trainable parameters, as they can hinder convergence in federated learning settings.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic Algorithm Configuration:</strong> The multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) used in these experiments is the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), which is known for its efficiency in handling multi-objective optimization problems. The algorithm parameters, such as population size, crossover probability, mutation probability, and bit length, are carefully chosen to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process.</p>

    <title>MONAS: Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search</title>
    <url>/2020/01/16/monasnet/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10332.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10332.pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>Despite the advancements in NAS, most existing works focus on optimizing models for high prediction accuracy, which often results in complex architectures that may not be suitable for deployment in computing environments with limited resources, such as battery-powered mobile devices. This limitation has motivated the development of MONAS (Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search), a novel framework that extends the capabilities of NAS by considering not only prediction accuracy but also other critical objectives like power consumption during the search for neural network architectures.</p>
<p>The primary motivation behind MONAS is to bridge the gap between high-performance models and deployability in resource-constrained settings. By integrating multi-objective optimization, MONAS allows for the search process to be guided by various performance metrics and application-specific constraints, leading to the discovery of networks that offer a balance between accuracy and efficiency. This approach aims to democratize the development of neural network architectures by making them accessible to a wider range of platforms and applications without compromising on performance.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>The paper introduces MONAS, a pioneering framework for Multi-Objective Neural Architectural Search, which stands out with its unique contributions to the field of neural network optimization. Firstly, it proposes a multi-objective approach that simultaneously considers prediction accuracy and additional critical objectives, such as energy consumption. This dual focus addresses the limitations of previous NAS methods, which often overlooked the trade-offs between performance and deployability in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330155922697.png" alt="image-20240330155922697"></p>
<p>Secondly, MONAS demonstrates adaptability by allowing users to incorporate customized constraints that reflect the specific requirements of different applications or platforms. This flexibility ensures that the search process is guided by a diverse set of objectives, leading to a broader spectrum of optimized architectures.</p>
<p>Additionally, the paper presents MONAS-S, an extension of the original framework, designed to enhance scalability and speed. By adopting weight-sharing techniques, MONAS-S is capable of searching larger design spaces more efficiently, significantly reducing the time required to find optimal network architectures.</p>
<p>The empirical results of the study show that models discovered by MONAS not only achieve comparable or better classification accuracy on computer vision tasks but also satisfy additional objectives such as peak power consumption. This evidences the effectiveness of MONAS in guiding the search process towards architectures that meet predefined constraints, outperforming state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and energy efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330160020944.png" alt="image-20240330160020944"></p>
<p>The MONAS framework is meticulously crafted to address the multifaceted challenges of neural architecture search. At its core, MONAS employs a two-stage framework that leverages reinforcement learning to navigate the complex landscape of neural network design. The first stage involves the generation of candidate architectures through a recurrent neural network (RNN), which serves as the “robot network” in the search process. This RNN generates a sequence of hyperparameters for a CNN, which are then used to construct and train the “target network” in the second stage. The performance of the target network, in terms of both accuracy and energy consumption, is feedback to the robot network as a reward signal, guiding the search process.</p>
<p>One of the distinguishing features of MONAS is its adaptability. It allows users to define customized constraints that can be seamlessly integrated into the search process as additional objectives. These constraints are transformed into reward functions that work in tandem with the primary objectives of accuracy and efficiency, ensuring that the search is aligned with the specific needs of various applications and platforms.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330160105915.png" alt="image-20240330160105915"></p>
<p>To enhance scalability, MONAS introduces a weight-sharing technique, which is further developed into MONAS-S. This extension pre-trains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encompasses all possible networks, allowing for a more efficient search process. The controller, which is the RNN in MONAS, is updated using the REINFORCE policy learning method, where the validation accuracy and other objective measures serve as the reward signal.</p>
<p>The reward function in MONAS is carefully designed to reflect the trade-offs between different objectives. It includes a mixed reward that balances accuracy and energy consumption, as well as constraints on peak power and Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations, which serve as a proxy for power usage. This nuanced approach to the reward function enables MONAS to discover architectures that not only perform well in terms of accuracy but also meet the energy efficiency requirements.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330160154008.png" alt="image-20240330160154008"></p>
<p>The experimental setup of the MONAS framework is designed to thoroughly evaluate its performance and efficacy in searching for neural network architectures that balance prediction accuracy with energy efficiency. The experiments are conducted using Python with the TensorFlow library, running on a system equipped with an Intel XEON E5-2620v4 processor and GeForce GTX1080Ti GPU cards. The NVIDIA profiling tool, nvprof, is utilized to measure the peak power and energy consumption of the target networks, which are crucial for updating the robot network’s weights.</p>
<p>The CIFAR-10 dataset is chosen to validate the target networks, with 5000 randomly selected images from the training set used as the validation set. The validation accuracy is taken as an objective in the reward function. The Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations of a sampled target network are calculated based on the approach described in MnasNet, providing a measure of the computational cost.</p>
<p>The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability and efficiency of MONAS in guiding the search process. When constraints are applied to limit peak power or require a minimum accuracy, MONAS successfully directs its search to regions that satisfy these conditions. For instance, out of 600 iterations, a significant number of target networks fall within the specified power or accuracy thresholds, indicating the framework’s ability to adapt to different reward functions.</p>
<p>The paper also explores how the Pareto Front changes under different reward functions, showing that MONAS can discover architectures with either higher accuracy or lower energy consumption depending on the weightage given to each objective. Notably, MONAS outperforms random search in finding better architectures within a limited search time, highlighting its efficiency.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330160230178.png" alt="image-20240330160230178"></p>
<p>In terms of discovering noteworthy architectures, MONAS is compared with state-of-the-art models like CondenseNet, demonstrating that it can find models with higher accuracy and lower energy consumption. The best-performing models discovered by MONAS are reported, along with their hyperparameters and energy costs per 1000 inferences, providing evidence of the framework’s capability to surpass existing solutions.</p>
<p>The scalability of MONAS is further validated through MONAS-S, which is applied to a search space of 1.6 × 10^29 possible networks in a 12-layered architecture. Even in this vast search space, MONAS-S successfully guides the search, finding models that require fewer MAC operations while maintaining high accuracy.</p>

    <title>Designing Neural Network Architectures using Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <url>/2020/01/17/metaqnn/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02167.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02167.pdf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330145949057.png" alt="image-20240330145949057"></p>
<p>In the realm of machine learning, the design of effective convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures has traditionally required significant human expertise and labor. The process involves a meticulous trial-and-error approach, where researchers draw upon theoretical insights and empirical observations to craft networks that perform well on specific tasks. As the complexity of CNNs has grown, so too has the design space, making manual exploration infeasible due to the combinatorial explosion of possible configurations.</p>
<p>The paper “Designing Neural Network Architectures Using Reinforcement Learning” addresses this challenge by introducing MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm that leverages reinforcement learning to automate the generation of high-performing CNN architectures. The motivation behind this approach is to reduce the manual effort involved in CNN design and to potentially discover novel architectures that humans might overlook.</p>
<p>MetaQNN employs a Q-learning agent that learns to select CNN layers sequentially, guided by an ε-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay to navigate the large but finite space of architectural possibilities. The agent’s goal is to optimize the network’s performance on a given learning task, as measured by validation accuracy, which serves as the reward signal.</p>
<p>This research is motivated by the desire to streamline the process of network design, enabling the development of tailored CNNs for various tasks without extensive human intervention. By automating this process, researchers can focus on higher-level tasks and insights, while the algorithm handles the intricacies of architecture optimization. The potential applications of this work are vast, as it could lead to more efficient and effective machine learning solutions across a range of domains.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>The paper “Designing Neural Network Architectures Using Reinforcement Learning” makes several significant contributions to the field of automated machine learning (AutoML). Firstly, it introduces MetaQNN, a novel algorithm that applies reinforcement learning to the design of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. This algorithm is capable of discovering high-performing CNNs without human intervention, addressing the labor-intensive nature of manual network design.</p>
<p>Secondly, the paper demonstrates that MetaQNN can compete with, and even outperform, state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. This is achieved by exploring a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively improving upon the designs based on validation accuracy.</p>
<p>Additionally, the paper shows that the networks designed by MetaQNN are not only optimized for the task they were trained on but also exhibit strong transfer learning capabilities. This indicates that the algorithm can produce versatile network architectures that are applicable to various image classification tasks.</p>
<p>Lastly, the research provides a new perspective on neural network design, suggesting that reinforcement learning can be an effective tool for automating the process. This opens up new avenues for future research in AutoML, where the goal is to further automate and optimize the machine learning pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330150424604.png" alt="image-20240330150424604"></p>
<p>The primary methodological innovation of the paper “Designing Neural Network Architectures Using Reinforcement Learning” is the MetaQNN algorithm, which utilizes Q-learning to automate the process of designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The core concept is to treat the selection of CNN layers as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the learning agent explores the space of possible network topologies to find high-performing architectures.</p>
<p>The MetaQNN agent is trained using Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning technique that focuses on learning the optimal policy through interaction with the environment. The agent operates in a state space defined by the parameters of the CNN layers and an action space that corresponds to the choices of adding a particular layer type. The agent starts with a random exploration of the architecture space, gradually transitioning to more informed decisions as it learns from experience.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330150453009.png" alt="image-20240330150453009"></p>
<p>A key component of the method is the ε-greedy exploration strategy, which balances exploration and exploitation. The agent initially explores widely by selecting actions randomly, with a probability ε. As the agent accumulates experience, it exploits its knowledge by choosing the action with the highest estimated Q-value with probability 1-ε. The value of ε is gradually decreased over time, shifting the agent’s behavior from exploration to exploitation.</p>
<p>To enhance learning efficiency, the MetaQNN algorithm employs experience replay, a technique where the agent’s past experiences are stored in a replay memory. The agent periodically samples from this memory to update its Q-values, allowing it to learn from its past actions more effectively.</p>
<p>The agent’s performance is evaluated based on the validation accuracy of the CNN architectures it designs. The architectures that yield higher validation accuracy are considered more desirable, and the agent’s Q-values are updated accordingly. The process continues until the agent converges on a policy that consistently produces high-performing CNN architectures.</p>
<p>This method represents a significant departure from traditional manual design processes, offering a data-driven approach to network architecture optimization. By automating the design process, MetaQNN has the potential to accelerate the development of CNNs and to discover novel architectures that could outperform those designed by human experts.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330150952925.png" alt="image-20240330150952925"></p>
<p>The experimental setup involves training a learning agent to sequentially choose CNN layers using Q-learning, with the goal of maximizing the validation accuracy on the given datasets. The agent’s state space is defined by the parameters of different layer types, such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, and the action space is determined by the possible layer selections. The agent employs an ε-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation, with ε gradually reduced over time to shift from random exploration to informed exploitation.</p>
<p>The training process for the agent involves aggressive training schemes with quick convergence, using techniques like dropout and learning rate adjustments to prevent overfitting and to ensure efficient learning. The agent’s performance is evaluated based on the validation accuracy of the CNN architectures it designs, which serves as the reward signal for the Q-learning updates.</p>

<p>The experimental results are highly promising. The networks designed by the MetaQNN agent outperform existing networks that use the same layer types, demonstrating the agent’s ability to make informed architectural decisions. Moreover, these networks are competitive with state-of-the-art methods that incorporate more complex layer types and training procedures, showcasing the potential of the MetaQNN approach to match or even surpass human-designed architectures.</p>

<p>In terms of transfer learning, the best MetaQNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset shows good performance when trained on other datasets, indicating the versatility of the architectures discovered by the algorithm. The ensemble of top models selected by the agent also leads to a significant boost in prediction performance, further validating the effectiveness of the MetaQNN approach.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments in the paper provide strong evidence that reinforcement learning can be effectively applied to the automated design of neural network architectures, offering a promising direction for future research in automating the machine learning process. The success of MetaQNN in discovering high-performing and transferable CNN architectures underscores the potential of this approach to revolutionize the way we design neural networks for various tasks.</p>

    <title>Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning</title>
    <url>/2020/01/02/nas/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>Zoph B, Le Q V. Neural architecture search with reinforcement learning[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01578, 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Motivation"><a href="#Motivation" class="headerlink" title="Motivation"></a>Motivation</h2><p>Imagine you’re on a quest to build the ultimate digital brain, a neural network so smart it could tackle the toughest challenges in image recognition and language understanding. Sounds like a job for the world’s brightest minds, right? That’s what it used to be. But designing neural networks by hand is a grind, involving endless trial and error, and a whole lot of coffee-fueled late nights.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330092934794.png" alt="image-20240330092934794"></p>
<p>This paper kicks off a revolution. It’s about Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning - think of it as a neural network that designs other neural networks. We’re talking about a game-changer here, a way to automate the process of creating these complex networks, which have been the backbone of many AI breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The motivation? To free researchers from the tedious task of manual design and let them focus on the big picture. The authors saw a gap: current methods are either too rigid or too slow to keep up with the ever-growing scale of neural networks. They needed something flexible, something scalable, and something that could learn from its successes and failures.</p>
<p>So, they came up with an approach that treats architecture design as a reinforcement learning problem. It’s like teaching an AI to be an architect, learning from experience and getting better over time. The result? A system that can craft neural networks that are not only top-performing but also more efficient than ever before. It’s a bold step towards a future where AI can design itself, and this paper is where it all begins.</p>
<h2 id="Contribution"><a href="#Contribution" class="headerlink" title="Contribution"></a>Contribution</h2><p>The main contribution of this paper is a method that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN), think of it as a creative AI artist, to generate the blueprints for new neural networks. Then, it employs reinforcement learning to train this RNN, aiming to maximize the accuracy of these newly minted architectures on a validation set.</p>
<p>The results are nothing short of impressive. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark for image recognition, the method crafted a novel network architecture that outperforms existing designs, achieving a test error rate of 3.65%. That’s not just a win on paper; it’s 1.05 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art model.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. On the Penn Treebank dataset, a language modeling task, the method composed a novel recurrent cell that outshines the widely-used LSTM cell. This new cell achieved a test set perplexity of 62.4, a significant 3.6 perplexity improvement over the previous best model.</p>
<p>The paper also dives into the nitty-gritty of the method, discussing how it can be accelerated with parallelism and asynchronous updates, and how it can increase architecture complexity with skip connections and other layer types. It even shows how the same method can be adapted to generate recurrent cell architectures, further expanding its versatility.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this paper is a giant leap towards making neural network design more accessible and efficient, opening up new possibilities for AI research and applications. It’s like handing the keys to the AI kingdom to the next generation of machine learning enthusiasts.</p>
<h2 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h2><p>Here’s where it gets interesting: this director, or controller RNN, is trained using reinforcement learning. It’s like training a newbie director by rewarding it for good takes (in this case, network designs that perform well on a validation set) and giving it constructive feedback (updating the RNN parameters) to help it improve shot after shot, design after design.</p>
<img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330102426278.png" alt="image-20240330102426278" style="zoom:33%;">

<p>The method starts with a simple premise: a neural network’s structure can be described by a variable-length string, which the RNN controller generates. It’s like the director writing the script for a movie. Once the script is written, it’s time to film the movie, which in this context means training the ‘child network’ on real data. The performance of the child network on a validation set is then used as a reward signal to train the director RNN.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330102532285.png" alt="image-20240330102532285"></p>
<p>The paper presents a few key improvements to this core approach. One is the introduction of skip connections and other layer types to increase the complexity of the generated architectures. It’s like allowing the director to experiment with different cinematography techniques to make the movie more engaging.</p>
<p>Another trick up the paper’s sleeve is using a parameter server approach for distributed training. Imagine having a team of production assistants who can handle different parts of the movie simultaneously. This speeds up the process of shooting the film and allows the director to try out more scenes in less time.</p>
<p>The paper also talks about generating recurrent cell architectures, which is like directing a movie with complex plotlines that loop back on themselves. The controller RNN has to figure out how to best connect the plot points (or layers) to create a coherent narrative (or functioning neural network).</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330102622433.png" alt="image-20240330102622433"></p>
<p>On the CIFAR-10 dataset, a playground for image recognition, the method brewed up a novel network architecture that outperforms the best human-invented recipes. The newly minted model sizzled with a test error rate of 3.65%, outclassing the previous state-of-the-art model by a whisker and cooking up results 1.05 times faster.</p>
<p><img lazyload="" src="/images/loading.svg" data-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hjchen-thu/picb/img_blog/image-20240330102649905.png" alt="image-20240330102649905"></p>
<p>But the authors weren’t content with just dishing out success in image recognition. They turned to the Penn Treebank dataset, a staple in language modeling, and whipped up a recurrent cell architecture that dethroned the reigning LSTM cell. This new cell architecture achieved a test set perplexity of 62.4, besting the previous record by a solid 3.6 perplexity points.</p>

<p>In the realm of deep learning, the design of neural network architectures has been significantly advanced by automated methods, offering a promising solution to the labor-intensive process of manual design. However, these conventional algorithms demand substantial computational resources, often requiring thousands of models to be trained on a single task, making their application to large-scale problems like ImageNet computationally prohibitive.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, researchers have historically employed proxy tasks—smaller datasets or simplified versions of the target task—to expedite the search process. While this approach reduces the computational burden, it introduces a critical limitation: architectures optimized for proxy tasks may not perform optimally on the actual target task, particularly when hardware metrics such as latency are considered.</p>
<p>This discrepancy between proxy-based training and real-world application has motivated the development of a novel approach that bypasses the need for proxies, allowing for direct learning of neural network architectures tailored to specific tasks and hardware platforms. By doing so, this method not only promises to enhance the performance and efficiency of neural networks but also aims to democratize the application of neural architecture search across various domains by significantly reducing the computational and memory costs associated with the process.</p>

<p>At the core of ProxylessNAS is the concept of path-level pruning, which treats the architecture search as a process of training an over-parameterized network that contains all candidate paths. This network is then pruned to eliminate redundancy and arrive at an optimized architecture. The method introduces architecture parameters to learn which paths are redundant, and these paths are pruned at the end of the training process.</p>

<p>To manage the high GPU memory consumption, the authors propose a binarization strategy for the architecture parameters. By converting the real-valued path weights into binary gates, the method ensures that only one path is active at runtime, thus reducing the memory requirement to the level of training a compact model. This binarization process is facilitated by a gradient-based training approach that leverages ideas from BinaryConnect.</p>

<p>In addition to addressing computational efficiency, the paper also presents techniques for handling non-differentiable hardware objectives such as latency. The authors propose a method to make latency differentiable by modeling it as a continuous function of the network’s architecture parameters. This allows the latency to be incorporated as a regularization term in the loss function, enabling the direct optimization of the network’s latency alongside its accuracy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the paper introduces an alternative strategy based on the REINFORCE algorithm to handle hardware metrics. This approach views the update of binarized architecture parameters as a process of maximizing a certain reward, which can handle non-differentiable objectives without requiring them to be differentiable.</p>

<p>The methodology is validated through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where the proposed approach demonstrates its ability to achieve superior empirical results. The direct search strategy allows for a more efficient exploration of the architecture space, leading to architectures that are not only accurate but also optimized for hardware-specific metrics such as latency.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper’s methodology represents a significant advancement in the field of NAS. It provides a new perspective on how to conduct architecture search in a way that is both computationally efficient and directly aligned with the target task and hardware. The introduction of techniques to handle non-differentiable objectives expands the scope of NAS and paves the way for the development of specialized neural network architectures for a variety of hardware platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Figures-Conclusion"><a href="#Figures-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Figures & Conclusion"></a>Figures &amp; Conclusion</h2><p>The experimental framework of the paper is meticulously designed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, ProxylessNAS, through a series of comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The experiments are aimed at demonstrating the method’s capacity to directly learn neural network architectures for large-scale tasks and target hardware platforms, as well as its ability to optimize for both accuracy and hardware-specific metrics such as latency.</p>

<p>The experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset utilize a tree-structured architecture space, employing a validation set of 5,000 images to learn architecture parameters. The method is evaluated based on the test error rate, with the ProxylessNAS achieving a remarkable 2.08% test error, outperforming previous state-of-the-art architectures like AmoebaNet-B. Notably, the model operates with only 5.7M parameters, significantly fewer than the 34.9M parameters of AmoebaNet-B, showcasing the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of parameter count.</p>

<p>On the ImageNet dataset, the experiments focus on learning efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures that balance high accuracy with low latency, particularly on mobile phones, GPUs, and CPUs. The architecture space is based on MobileNetV2, with a variety of mobile inverted bottleneck convolution (MBConv) layers and expansion ratios allowed. The method incorporates a latency prediction model during the search process, which correlates strongly with real-world latency measurements, demonstrating the model’s predictive accuracy.</p>

<p>The results on ImageNet are equally impressive, with the proposed method improving the top-1 accuracy by 2.6% over MobileNetV2 while maintaining a similar latency on mobile phones. The model also outperforms MnasNet in terms of accuracy, with a 0.6% higher top-1 accuracy and slightly lower mobile latency, all while using significantly fewer GPU hours for the search process.</p>

<p>The paper further explores the specialized models optimized for different hardware platforms, revealing that each platform prefers distinct architectural designs. For instance, the GPU model tends to be shallower and wider, while the CPU model opts for deeper and narrower architectures. The mobile model exhibits a preference for larger MBConv operations in the initial stages of each layer where downsampling occurs.</p>
